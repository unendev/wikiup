When first starting out, finding [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") or [Beefalos](/wiki/Beefalos "Beefalos") can be difficult. Players may not get enough [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure") for [Farming](/wiki/Farming "Farming") and food collection. A second option is to establish a base camp near a frog pond area. [Frogs](/wiki/Frogs "Frogs") can be killed with the basic trap just like rabbits but they have several advantages:

* Frogs can be kited into traps.
* Several frogs can spawn from one pond and the ponds are often very close to each other.
* Frogs count as monsters and killing them does not increase a player's naughty level. This means a player may trap as many frogs as needed without summoning [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus").

## Finding Frog Ponds[]

Search for Ponds in the [Grassland](/wiki/Grasslands "Grasslands") biome. [Ponds](/wiki/Ponds "Ponds") will show on the map as light blue water circles with a green border. The [Mosquito Pond](/wiki/Mosquito_Pond "Mosquito Pond") is a similar shape, but purple, and are found in the [Marsh Biome](/wiki/Marsh "Marsh"). There is usually a [Cobblestone](/wiki/Cobblestones "Cobblestones") [Road](/wiki/Road "Road") crossing the grasslands with many ponds close together so following a cobblestone road when exploring might be a good idea. An ideal location has more than one pond, as a single pond won't spawn enough frogs to support a player through winter.

## Setting up Camp[]

Once a suitable location is found, camp should be set up a small distance away from the ponds to keep frogs from attacking players during the day. Twigs and grass supplies will be useful for crafting [Traps](/wiki/Traps "Traps") and [Drying Racks](/wiki/Drying_Racks "Drying Racks"). [Drying Racks](/wiki/Drying_Racks "Drying Racks") are important because they allow players to turn excess frog legs into [Jerky](/wiki/Jerky "Jerky"), providing a stable food source for winter. Ideally, at least 3 Drying Racks should be utilized for this camp setup. Finally, crafting a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") will allow players to cook better food like [Froggle Bunwich](/wiki/Froggle_Bunwich "Froggle Bunwich") by placing [Frog Legs](/wiki/Frog_Legs "Frog Legs") into the pot.

## Catching Frogs[]

Catching [Frogs](/wiki/Frogs "Frogs") is quite easy but a [Log Suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit") will help with taking the occasional hit. The best way to catch them is to observe the direction they hop and place a trap right in front of them. They aren't very quick to react to the player and usually just continue hopping into the [Trap](/wiki/Trap "Trap"), if they do become aggressive they can still be kited into it. If there are enough frogs in close proximity the player can hunt with several traps at once, grabbing caught frogs and resetting traps constantly. One trap will catch 8 frogs before breaking, exhausting two or three should be no problem during the [day](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle"). At dusk frogs will return to their ponds giving the player some time to fish risk free if a [fishing rod](/wiki/Fishing_Rod "Fishing Rod") is available.

As of the [The End of the Beginning](/wiki/Version_History "Version History") update (April 19, 2013) frogs have become quicker and more aggressive when chasing the player. They also jump farther, allowing them to sometimes jump over traps without triggering them. This makes frog hunting slightly riskier and kiting them more difficult.

## Further development[]

Since you want to be ready for [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), try to increase the number of [Drying Racks](/wiki/Drying_Racks "Drying Racks") to about 8 but you can build as many as you can keep stocked. The goal is to catch enough frogs in one day so that you have enough to eat and dry for the next two. This way you can alternate between catching frogs and exploring for more resources. Try to plant some [Saplings](/wiki/Saplings "Saplings") around your camp so you have a reliable source of twigs. Adding a lightning rod helps keep your saplings and nearby trees from burning. Also if you find spiders you should hunt for [Silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk") since [Fishing](/wiki/Fishing "Fishing") is a great addition to frog hunting. Just sit in between several traps while fishing and grab any frogs that get caught. Finally if you do find a source of [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure"), you can still add some farms to your camp or wait until the winter is over to relocate.

## Cooking with Frog Legs[]

[Frog Legs](/wiki/Frog_Legs "Frog Legs") are very versatile when used in the crock pot. Four frog legs will produce [Meatballs](/wiki/Meatballs "Meatballs") which provides 62.5 hunger points. Frog Legs can be combined with [Vegetables](/wiki/Vegetables "Vegetables") to produce a [Froggle Bunwich](/wiki/Froggle_Bunwich "Froggle Bunwich") which restores [Health](/wiki/Health "Health"). Finally, if you can get a fishing rod, [Fishsticks](/wiki/Fishsticks "Fishsticks") are an even better source of health. In addition, if you have a [Bee Box](/wiki/Bee_Box "Bee Box") any combination of [Honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey") and Frog Legs makes [Honey Nuggets](/wiki/Honey_Nuggets "Honey Nuggets").
