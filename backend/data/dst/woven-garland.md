The Woven Garland is an item added to The Forge in Don't Starve Together.

It is put on the cell of the head. Increases the health gain of all characters standing in the bloom of life by 20%.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The effect is applied during the use of the staff of life, if at that moment the wreath was on the healer's head. After that, you can change the winding wreath to a crystal tiara to reduce the recharge time of the staff.
