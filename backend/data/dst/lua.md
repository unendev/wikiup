**Lua** is a lightweight scripting language that is used by the game engine which runs *Don't Starve*. The core game is written in C++, although all game prefabs and modifications for the game are written in Lua. Lua is free to download and is released under the MIT license. To learn more about Lua, visit the official website at [Lua.org](http://www.lua.org). This typed scripting language is compact enough to fit on a variety of platforms. It supports only a small number of data structures such as [boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type "wikipedia:Boolean data type") values, numbers, and [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science) "wikipedia:String (computer science)"). Lua implements a small set of advanced features such as [first-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function "wikipedia:First-class function"), [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science) "wikipedia:Garbage collection (computer science)"), [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science) "wikipedia:Closure (computer science)"), proper [tail calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_recursion "wikipedia:Tail recursion"), [coercion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion "wikipedia:Type conversion") (automatic conversion between string and number values at run time), [coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine "wikipedia:Coroutine") (cooperative multitasking) and dynamic module loading.

*Don't Starve* and *Don't Starve Together* use a slightly modified version of Lua 5.1.4.[[1]](#cite_note-1)

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* "Lua" is not an acronym; it is the Portuguese word for "moon".
* Lua is used in other games for content creation such as *[Garry's Mod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry%27s_Mod "wikipedia:Garry's Mod"), [The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac:_Rebirth?wprov=sfti1),* and *[Empire: Total War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire:_Total_War "wikipedia:Empire: Total War")*.
