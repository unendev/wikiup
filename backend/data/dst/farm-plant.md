## Farm Plants[]

Farm Plants are obtained by planting [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") into [Farm Soil](/wiki/Farm_Soil "Farm Soil"). The seeds have a chance to produce different plants based on the [Season](/wiki/Seasons "Seasons").

Plants have 5 growth stages: Seed, Sprout, Small, Medium and Grown. At each new stage, the plant may gain [Stress](#Stress) points depending on its condition. The total accumulated stress changes the output of a grown plant:

* 0 to 1 stress point: becomes a [Giant Crop](/wiki/Giant_Crops "Giant Crops")
* 2 to 6 stress points: 1 fruit/vegetable and 2 crop seeds
* 7 to 11 stress points: 1 fruit/vegetable and 1 crop seed
* 12 or more: 1 fruit/vegetable (no seeds)

Only the stress gained at the beginning of each growth stage counts.

Plants also grow faster with less stress. Growth is twice as fast if the season is one of the plant's favorite seasons. Unlike [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree"), [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") and other world-spawned plants, farm plants only grow in the presence of daylight, i.e. during [day](/wiki/Day "Day") and [dusk](/wiki/Dusk "Dusk") on the surface, under [Cave Lights](/wiki/Cave_Light "Cave Light"), [Lux Aeterna](/wiki/Books#Lux_Aeterna_Redux "Books"), or near a [Dwarf Star](/wiki/Dwarf_Star "Dwarf Star").

Growth time in daylight (full day of 480 seconds)

| Stage | In Season | | Off Season | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low stress | High stress | Low stress | High stress |
| Seeds | 0.375 - 0.5 | | 0.75 - 1 | |
| Sprout | 1 | 1.75 | 2 | 3.5 |
| Small | 0.6 | 1.05 | 1.2 | 2.1 |
| Medium | 0.4 | 0.7 | 0.8 | 1.4 |
| **Total** | **~2.5** | **~4** | **~5** | **~8** |

All seeds have a random germination time from 0.75 to 1 day off-season and twice as fast in-season. Random seeds only determine what they grow after germination, with a 20% chance of being a [Weed](/wiki/Weeds "Weeds").

After reaching the grown stage, a normal crop will rot in 4 days and a giant crop in 6 days. If they have been planted by [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood"), they last 50% longer before spoiling. After 4 to 5 days of rotting, a non-giant plant grows back and the new plant cannot become giant.

If there are 15 or more fully grown or rotten plants within a 4 meter radius, the [Lord of the Fruit Flies](/wiki/Lord_of_the_Fruit_Flies "Lord of the Fruit Flies") may appear. A [Fruit Fly](/wiki/Fruit_Fly "Fruit Fly") has a 5% chance to spawn when a player picks a non-giant rotten farm plant.

Farm plants are immune to [Smoldering](/wiki/Summer#Wildfires "Summer") as long as they are on wet ground.

## Stress[]

There are 7 sources of stress for farm plants. The condition of the plant is checked at the beginning of each new stage (sprout, small, medium and growth), and it can accumulate up to 28 stress points.

### Nutrients[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 See also: [Nutrient](/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient")*

There are 3 types of [Nutrients](/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient") and each farm soil tile contains some amount of each nutrient. At the end of each growth stage, farm plants [consume and produce nutrients](#Summary). If the farm soil tile contains fewer nutrients than the plant requires, the plant accumulates 1 stress point and produces fewer nutrients itself.
Weeds only consume nutrient and produce none. [Fertilizer](/wiki/Nutrient#Fertilizer "Nutrient") can be used to increase nutrients in the ground. Because only farm soil tiles can contain nutrients, seeds planted by Wormwood on other tiles will always accumulate 4 nutrient stress points. Nutrient levels can be made easier to see by wearing the [Premier Gardeneer Hat](/wiki/Gardeneer_Hat "Gardeneer Hat"). Wormwood can naturally see nutrient levels without the aid of the hat.

### Moisture[]

At each stage, if the plant was on wet ground for less than 10% of the time since the previous stage, it accumulates 1 stress point.

* Each tile has its own moisture, from 0 to 100 points; a non-zero moisture value makes it "wet ground".
* Each use of a [Watering Can](/wiki/Watering_Can "Watering Can"), a [Waterfowl Can](/wiki/Waterfowl_Can "Waterfowl Can") or a [Water Balloon](/wiki/Water_Balloon "Water Balloon") will add 25 points of moisture. [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice") melting will add 20 points of moisture. [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") increases moisture at up to 1.5 points per second depending on the rain rate.
* Moisture naturally decreases, depending on the world temperature, with no drying below 0° to 0.05 points per seconds above 70°, regardless of the time of day.
* [Additional plants will drain more moisture](#Summary) per second, regardless of there being any daylight.
* The moisture will never become less than the world wetness, no matter how many plants are on the farm soil tile.

It suffices to water a tile once per stage. Because only farm soil tiles can be watered, seeds planted by Wormwood on other tiles will accumulate 4 moisture stress points if there is no rain.

Growing under a [Dwarf Star](/wiki/Dwarf_Star "Dwarf Star") reduces water consumption by up to 33% due to earlier maturity.

### Killjoys[]

At the end of each growth stage, the plant accumulates 1 stress point if there are [Weeds](/wiki/Weeds "Weeds"), [Garden Detritus](/wiki/Garden_Detritus "Garden Detritus"), or rotten crops within 1.5 [Tiles](/wiki/Tile "Tile").

### Season[]

At the end of each growth stage, if the current season is not one of the plant's favorites, the plant accumulates 1 stress point. Additionally, crops will grow twice as quickly when grown during their preferred seasons (highlighted in green in the Summary table).

### Family[]

At the end of each growth stage, the plant accumulates 1 stress point if there are less than 4, including the one checking, of the same type within a 1 [Tile](/wiki/Tile "Tile") radius (4 wall units).

### Overcrowding[]

At the end of each growth stage, the plant accumulates 1 stress point if there are more than 10 farm plants or weeds on the same tile.

### Happiness[]

At each growth stage, if the plant was not attended to since the last stage, the plant accumulates 1 stress point.
Plants can be attended to manually by the player (unless playing as Wes as he is unable to talk) or by using items that attend to all plants within their range (see table).

Plants can be attended to by a [Friendly Fruit Fly](/wiki/Friendly_Fruit_Fly "Friendly Fruit Fly"). [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") tends all plants within 4m when he has bloomed (6m after learning the [Farmhand Skill](/wiki/Insight#Wormwood "Insight")). [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") can tend all plants within a range of 12m if they have the [Chorusbox Circuit](/wiki/Chorusbox_Circuit "Chorusbox Circuit") plugged in. Catching [Fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire") or being attacked by enemy [Fruit Flies](/wiki/Lord_of_the_Fruit_Flies "Lord of the Fruit Flies") will undo tending on plants, and the plant will need to be attended to again to avoid stress.

| Item | Range (metres) |
| --- | --- |
| Beefalo Horn | 25 |
| Strident Trident1 Gnarwail Horn1 | 20 |
| Pan Flute | 15 |
| One-man Band | 12 |
| Gramophone | 8 |
| Baritone Shell Bell | 2 |

1 *Only usable on water, so plants have to be near a shore.*

## Research[]

[Gardeneer Hat](/wiki/Gardeneer_Hat "Gardeneer Hat") enables research on crops and weeds, which identifies crops, weeds, and seeds in current and future games. Each stage of the crop and seed, is researchable. [Plant registry](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium") is accessible by right-clicking on the hat. Thus, [Weeds](/wiki/Weeds "Weeds") can be easily identified and then killed to avoid stressing other plants.

## Summary[]

Below is a table of all farm plants, their favorite seasons (highlighted in green), their nutrient effect (negative is consumption; positive is production), and their drink rate.

## Farming Strategy[]

[Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") can plant seeds anywhere on the ground, but all other characters must craft and deploy a [Garden Digamajig](/wiki/Garden_Digamajig "Garden Digamajig") to make [Farm Soil](/wiki/Farm_Soil "Farm Soil") and craft a [Garden Hoe](/wiki/Garden_Hoe "Garden Hoe") to till mounds in the Farm Soil to plant in.

At first, generic seeds are planted to see what they produce. If the goal is to produce random vegetables for crock pot filler, a single tomato for a [Rude Interlude](/wiki/Battle_Songs "Battle Songs"), or a single potato for [Astroggles](/wiki/Astroggles "Astroggles"), it's probably fine to just come back in a few days and hope for your tomato/potato/filler. If the goal is to produce quantities of specific foods, like garlic, peppers, and onions for Warly's spices, you'll want to maximize yield (of both crops and seeds) which means minimizing plant stress. If stress is low enough, crops can even become [Giant Crops](/wiki/Giant_Crops "Giant Crops")!

To Minimize stress:

* Plant an even tiling of 9 plants/tile (10 is allowed, but complicated)
* Remove [Garden Detritus](/wiki/Garden_Detritus "Garden Detritus") and rotted plants within 1.5 tiles.
* Dig up [Weed](/wiki/Weeds "Weeds") with a shovel as soon as they can be identified.
* Water must be provided by [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") or [Watering Can](/wiki/Watering_Can "Watering Can") to keep soil moisture above 0 at each growth stage. In [Spring](/wiki/Seasons/Spring "Seasons/Spring"), the natural rainfall may be sufficient.
* Nutrients must be available (above zero at each growth stage). These can be provided by Companion Planting (detailed below) or by manually adding fertilizer.
* Happiness should be maintained at each growth stage, typically by equipping a [One-man Band](/wiki/One-man_Band "One-man Band") for an instant.
* Once at least 4 seeds of the desired crop are obtained, they can be grown together as a "family" for lower stress which will yield more seeds and possibly giant crops.

Once mature, plants must be harvested within a few days or they will rot. Rotted plants will eventually regrow (as the same kind of plant) but cannot grow giant after rotting. Wormwood's plantings take 50% longer to rot.

Wearing a [Seed Pack-It](/wiki/Seed_Pack-It "Seed Pack-It") while harvesting is a great help in managing inventory and keeps the seeds fresh twice as long, just like an [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box") (but not eternally like [Bundling Wrap](/wiki/Bundling_Wrap "Bundling Wrap")).

A grown crop can be fed to a bird in return for a single seed of that crop type.

#### Speed-ups[]

* If enough generic seeds are available, [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom") can read [Horticulture, Expanded](/wiki/Books#Horticulture,_Expanded "Books") (or Abridged) to churn through generations of plants quickly, then the good fruits/vegetables fed to a bird to produce crop-specific seeds. The light from [Books#Lux\_Aeterna\_Redux](/wiki/Books#Lux_Aeterna_Redux "Books") allows plants to grow through the night.
* A nearby [Dwarf Star](/wiki/Star_Caller%27s_Staff#Dwarf_Star "Star Caller's Staff") or [Moon\_Caller's\_Staff#Polar\_Light](/wiki/Moon_Caller%27s_Staff#Polar_Light "Moon Caller's Staff") will also cause plants to grow through the night, but the Dwarf Star can light things (including any crop but [Dragon Fruit](/wiki/Dragon_Fruit "Dragon Fruit")) on fire.
* Wormwood can plant without tilling, even without garden soil. When Wormwood is blooming, just his presence makes the seeds happy.
* [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78")'s [Chorusbox Circuit](/wiki/Circuits#Chorusbox_Circuit "Circuits") also makes nearby plants happy while it increases sanity.

#### Companion Planting[]

Autumn Giant Crop Combinations[[1]](#cite_note-1) (self-fertilizing)

 

Companion Planting is the technique of planting different crops in the same tiles, usually to meet each other's [Nutrient](/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient") needs so that little or no fertilization is required, but possibly to require just a single nutrient. The [Summary Table](#Summary) is critical for finding the best crops to balance each other. For best results, plots should have some of each nutrient to begin with.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/2e/Winter giant crops.png/revision/latest?cb=20221229093904 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/2e/Winter giant crops.png/revision/latest?cb=20221229093904 

Winter Giant Crop Combinations [[2]](#cite_note-2) (self-fertilizing) Note: Garlic can substitute Asparagus.

 

Different crop combinations are ideal for each Season to avoid Stress and slowed growth. Combinations work even if some plants grow slower, while their neighbors are harvested and replanted. The off-season "nurse" crops won't grow giant. For example, planting Corn + Carrot + Potato in Winter, the Corn will grow at half-speed, but still meet the nutrient needs of the other plants.

The best combinations are the ones that meet the player's needs. Here are some typical crop combinations. Plant at least 4 of each plant. All ratios are 1:1 (or 1:1:1) unless specified.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/fa/Spring giant crops.png/revision/latest?cb=20221229093907 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/fa/Spring giant crops.png/revision/latest?cb=20221229093907

Summer Giant Crop Combinations[[4]](#cite_note-4) (self-fertilizing)

 

Nutrients are calculated per-tile, not in a radius around each plant, so be mindful to have the right proportion of plants in each tile, while also connecting the plants to their families in other tiles. This is most easily accomplished by tilling 3 mounds/tile and planting rows. If tilling becomes difficult, or you wish to achieve certain combinations (10 mounds per tile), then the snapping tills mod can be helpful.

### Weed farming[]

[Forget-Me-Lots](/wiki/Forget-Me-Lots "Forget-Me-Lots") can be farmed for [Soothing Tea](/wiki/Soothing_Tea "Soothing Tea"). A separate garden may be left for Forget-Me-Lots, away from the main farms. They have to be harvested every 2 days, or some of them dug up to renew the yield.
