### Developer

[Klei Entertainment](/wiki/Klei_Entertainment "Klei Entertainment")

### Beta Release Date

August 11, 2016

### Release Date

April 6, 2017

***A New Reign***, previously known as ***Through the Ages***, is a free *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* expansion. It was distributed as an "Update Chain", meant to add game changing features, like *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* and *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* did to *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")*. Similar to the latter, *A New Reign* started as a beta.

Between August 2016 and March 2017, *Don't Starve Together* received an update every 3 weeks, adding new content into the beta branch. Once stable, this content was added to the main version, becoming official. It then became inseparable from the original game.

## Official Description[]

### A New Reign: Part 1[]

*The shadow queen Charlie has begun to make her mark on the Don't Starve world, and her influence is manifesting in new and mysterious ways. What is her plan for Wilson and the survivors? Will she aid them in their fight for survival, or does she have something more dastardly in store?*

### A New Reign: Part 2[]

*Charlie the shadow queen has been plotting dark new challenges for Wilson and his fellow survivors from her umbral throneroom, and she’s ready to unleash her latest creations on the world of Don’t Starve Together!*

### Final[]

*The reign of the new shadow queen has swept across the land of Don't Starve Together and now creeps deep into the bowels of the earth. What ancient secrets will be dredged up by Charlie's dark machinations, and what purpose does she have in mind for the formidable being at the center of the Ruins?*

## Delay[]

The content pack was officially announced for late Spring 2015,[[4]](#cite_note-4) but its development had to be pulled back as the developers had issues implementing the [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") and *Reign of Giants* content into the game.[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[6]](#cite_note-6) This explains why some of its features were released a long time before being announced as part of it, like [Beefalo Domestication](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Beefalo_Domestication "Don't Starve Together") and [Disease](/wiki/Disease "Disease"). The expansion was renamed to *A New Reign* on August 8, 2016.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

## Features[]

Below are the features included in *A New Reign*.

**The features marked with Don't Starve were later introduced to the singleplayer version of *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* in the *[Quality of Life](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve/Version_History "Don't Starve/Version History")* update.**

### Resource Variants[]

[Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bushes "Berry Bushes"), [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tufts "Grass Tufts"), and [Saplings](/wiki/Saplings "Saplings") each have an alternate form ([Juicy Berry Bushes](/wiki/Juicy_Berry_Bushes "Juicy Berry Bushes"), [Grass Gekkos](/wiki/Grass_Gekkos "Grass Gekkos"), and [Twiggy Trees](/wiki/Twiggy_Trees "Twiggy Trees"), respectively). The alternate forms can co-exist with normal forms, providing additional methods of obtaining the respective resource, or an alternative resource in the case of Juicy Berry Bushes.

### Tweaks/Changes to existing content[]

* *A New Reign* introduced different [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") icons for Don't Starve regular and Gold Vein [Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder") Don't Starve, as well as icons for chopped or burnt [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree").
* The [Compass](/wiki/Compass "Compass") can now be used to reveal the global positions of several players on the map if all of them hold one equipped, even if they are far away from each other.
* The Resource Swapping System previously implemented in the game has been removed. All available resource variants, such as [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") and Twiggy Trees, can now co-exist in the same world. They will either be generated at world start or will slowly be brought in by [World Regrowth](/wiki/Regrowth "Regrowth"). Grass Gekkos now have a chance to be spawned after harvesting or digging up Grass Tufts.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* *A New Reign* is also the name of the [animated short](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#A_New_Reign_Cinematic "Animated Shorts and Trailers") first seen on the [Cyclum Puzzles](/wiki/Cyclum_Puzzles "Cyclum Puzzles"), then released for public view when the game left Early Access. This may also be an explanation for the name change.
* In each update, some [Roses](/wiki/Flower#Rose "Flower") are scattered around the Update Teaser. The number of roses is indicative of the update number.

We’ve been working on rubber banding, network performance, bugs, balance, administrative tools for hosts, full mod support, and we’ve even been adding new DST-specific content.
   In addition to these things, we knew that we would also need larger scale content to really support the new worlds that are being created. Specifically, worlds are lasting not just months but years, and those who are behind the scenes are unhappy with how easy-going the inhabitants have become.
   We’re thus working on a brand new, free content pack called “Through the Ages”, chock full of new content designed specifically for multiplayer. This expansion is free for all players, and will be available in the Spring of 2015." Posted on November 24, 2014.

Specifically, Through the Ages is something we discussed in the forums, but has not yet been implemented. It’s always been on our mind, but the core design team had their hands full implementing Reign of Giants and Caves, and simply didn’t have the bandwidth to get onto the new content. Implementing caves especially was a huge undertaking, and we’re still trying to make the process of starting your own caves servers as smooth as possible." Posted on December 23, 2015.

[↑](#cite_ref-6) [Don't Starve Together leaving Early Access!](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/66132-dont-starve-together-leaving-early-access/) post by Bigfoot: "Many moons ago, we discussed launching Through the Ages, and it got waylaid by getting to content parity. We felt strongly that getting to parity at our quality standard was the most important priority, and it took much longer than expected. We’re finally here, and we are now actively working on new content. The team is breathing a sigh of relief that we get to build brand new content again.
   I’m going to leave Ipsquiggle to talk about Through the Ages as it evolves, but the first step of it is coming to you at Launch: we’re putting in small variations to the basic biomes so that every generation feels a bit different, and these will transition over time as you play through the seasons.
   As a refresher, the focus of TTA is the evolution of your world over a longer period of time, and more variation between worlds. This will take time to develop, and we will keep you in the loop both in beta branches and through our Rhymes With Play twitch stream, and of course right here in the forums. I’d say this is going to take about 6 months to develop, but uh, I’ve been off before." Posted on April 6, 2016.
