**“**A well deserved rest, no doubt.**”**

–[Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom")

**Saving** is an option available to the player and an integral mechanic of *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")*. The player can save and quit during any part of the game, and it will also automatically save at random intervals, usually once a game [day](/wiki/Day "Day"). If the player dies and has a [resurrection item](/wiki/Category:Resurrection "Category:Resurrection"), the game will also automatically save before the player is revived.

When the player dies with no resurrection items, unless they're playing in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"), the save file will be deleted. Otherwise, the progress made in Adventure Mode will be lost and the player will respawn with no penalty in front of [Maxwell's Door](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door"). The player can also delete save files from the slot selection menu. Deleting a save file will not earn any of the [Experience](/wiki/Experience "Experience") the player would've earned, which means that it's better to commit suicide if all characters are not unlocked.

## Don't Starve[]

There are four save files available in *Don't Starve* (Five with the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC). When players pick an empty slot, they can first choose a [character](/wiki/Character "Character") and customize the world before delving in. For world customization details, please go [here](/wiki/World_Customization "World Customization"). Each occupied slot shows an image of the character being played, the world number, and the world type ([Survival Mode](/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"), [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"), [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") or [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins")), then the number of days survived in that world connected by a dash unless the player is underground.

Each death will also be registered in the [Morgue](/wiki/Morgue "Morgue"), whether or not it's permanent.

The save file can be found under:

```
Windows: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\{unique ID}\{219740}\remote\
Mac OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Steam/userdata/{unique ID}/219740/remote/
Linux: ~/.steam/steam/userdata/{unique ID}/219740/
SteamOS: /home/steam/.local/share/Steam/userdata/{unique ID}/219740/

```

If Steam Cloud is disabled (or release without Steam), players can find their save files under

```
Windows: My Documents\Klei\DoNotStarve\save\
Mac OS X: ~/Documents/Klei/DoNotStarve/save/
Linux: ~/.klei/DoNotStarve/

```

Here is a list of files in the game save file:

* **profile**: files that record a player's experience and characters unlocked.
* **survival\_(number)**: a player's save in Sandbox Mode.
* **adventure\_(number)**: a player's save in Adventure Mode.
* **cave\_(number)**: a player's save in a Cave or Ruin.
* **saveindex**: description for all save slots in "Choose A Slot" menu.
* **morgue:**a record of all the player's deaths.

The number of save slots can be changed by editing the `NUM_SAVE_SLOTS` constant in the game files.[[1]](#cite_note-1)

## Don't Starve Together[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, saving works similarly to *Don't Starve*, except that saves are only saved on the host's computer, not the client's.

**Rollback** is a new feature that allows the host or an administrator of a world to instantly revert the current world to a previous save. This allows players to undo unwanted changes to a world and is a useful tool to fight griefing. The game will keep the last five saves of the world, meaning that the world can be rolled back a maximum of five days.

The number of save states kept can be changed by modifying `max_snapshots` in the `cluster.ini` file under the Dedicated Server save. The default is 6, which corresponds to 5 rollbacks.[[2]](#cite_note-2)

Saves can be triggered additionally using the `c_save()` [console command](/wiki/Console/Don%27t_Starve_Together_Commands "Console/Don't Starve Together Commands"). Rollback can be triggered in the console too, using `c_rollback()`.

Save frequency can be changed using mods.
