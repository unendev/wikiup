Definitions for the erudite and articulate, to further cultivate their considerable edification. (Meanings of gaming abbreviations and phrases for people new to the game, or for people who want to extend their gaming vocabulary.)

Almost all terms here are videogame jargon. Those that aren't are unique to the *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* games. As such, they don't hold quite the same meaning as one would find in the *Oxford English Dictionary*. Some definitions have been paraphrased, but footnotes provide the full and original source text.
