**“**You haven't heard the last of Maybelle Dorothea Wheeler!**”**

–**Wheeler**

**Maybelle Dorothea Wheeler** is a [Character](/wiki/Characters "Characters") exclusive to the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC. Wheeler is the tenth character to be unlocked via [Experience](/wiki/Experience "Experience"), requiring 3200 XP to become available. She is an adventure-seeking aeronaut who crashed her hot air balloon and became lost in [The Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant").

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Wheeler was officially added to the *Hamlet* Early Access beta branch on [April 18, 2019](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet#April_18.2C_2019 "Don't Starve: Hamlet"), alongside [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff").[[1]](#cite_note-1)
* Wheeler is voiced by a ragtime piano.
* In the roadmap forum post where she was first teased, she was described as "*a globetrotting adventurer lost and alone.*"[[2]](#cite_note-2).
* On the [Steam page for *Hamlet*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/712640/Dont_Starve_Hamlet/), she is described as "*A gutsy aeronaut whose latest adventure has blown off course.*"[[3]](#cite_note-3).
* Her middle name, Dorothea, may be a reference to [Dorothy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Gale "wikipedia:Dorothy Gale") of *[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz "wikipedia:The Wonderful Wizard of Oz")*.
* In her original in-game design, she had a frown and neutral eyebrows. In the [Early Access update 329526](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet#April_29th,_2019 "Don't Starve: Hamlet"), it was changed to give her a smile and angled eyebrows similar to her character portrait.[[4]](#cite_note-4) Images depicting her previous design can be found in the [gallery](#Gallery) below.
* During the first versions of *Hamlet*, Wheeler used to have 15 inventory slots and her base [movement speed](/wiki/Player_Speed "Player Speed") was 10% higher compared to other characters. She also used to have 10 inventory slots and 150 Health.
* She has a history playing stick ball.[[5]](#cite_note-5)
* Her health is the second least in the singleplayer version of the game, the first being [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell")'s.
* Wheeler is one of the five characters whose full name is known, the others being [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell"), [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson"), [Wendy](/wiki/Wendy "Wendy"), and [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff").
* When struck by [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning"), Wheeler is shown to have bones in her hair, much like other characters.
* Wheeler seems to love scrambled eggs, based off of her quotes for multiple egg foods, such as [Doydoy Eggs](/wiki/Doydoy_Egg "Doydoy Egg"), [Fried Tallbird Eggs](/wiki/Tallbird_Egg "Tallbird Egg"), and [Cooked Eggs](/wiki/Egg "Egg").
