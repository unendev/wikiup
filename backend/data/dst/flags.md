Swinesbury Flag

Palace City Flag

Player Flag

The flag is not a structure in the game. They display what an object refers to. In total there are 4 types of flags in the game. The first indicates that the object belongs to the [Pig City](/wiki/Pig_City "Pig City") of Swinesbury. The second that the object belongs to the [Palace City](/wiki/Pig_City "Pig City"). Third, that the object is located on the territory of the [Palace](/wiki/Palace "Palace"). Fourth, that the object was created by the player. The fourth flag can also be found on the Watch Tower next to the [Lever Thing](/wiki/Lever_Thing "Lever Thing"). Flags appear on [Watch Tower](/wiki/Watch_Tower "Watch Tower"), [Palace Watch Tower](/wiki/Watch_Tower "Watch Tower") and [City Hall](/wiki/Swinesbury_City_Hall "Swinesbury City Hall").

## Trivia[]

* The Palace Watch Tower will always have the Queen Flag, however if you spawn it with a command it will have the player's flag.
* All flags have unrealized burnt models.
* There are [unused flags](/wiki/Unimplemented_Mechanics_and_Animations#Flag "Unimplemented Mechanics and Animations") that also have burnt models, but do not have a flagpole.
* There is a model of an [unused shadow flag](/wiki/Unimplemented_Mechanics_and_Animations#Shadow_Flag "Unimplemented Mechanics and Animations").
