This is a survival guide written for players starting out in the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")* DLC, which deviates in some aspects from the formula shared by the other DLCs in addition to adding many new features. This guide is for features and strategies exclusive to *Hamlet*. For players who have not played Don't Starve before, see [this guide](/wiki/Guides/Getting_Started_Guide "Guides/Getting Started Guide"). This guide only covers the first few days of the DLC.

## Day 1[]

The first thing you will notice after waking up is your spawn point. Similar to *Shipwrecked*, the pieces of debris around you can be hammered for resources. More importantly, however, is a [machete](/wiki/Machete "Machete") on the floor. This machete is vital to your survival, as the [Tall Grass](/wiki/Tall_Grass "Tall Grass") must be harvested with it. Begin harvesting [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") as you would normally, and hack at the tall grass with your machete. Flip [Stone Slabs](/wiki/Stone_Slab "Stone Slab") to obtain flint for tools. You should also try to collect as many [exotic flowers](/wiki/Flower#Exotic_Flower "Flower") as you can find, as you can feed the pigs of the cities with those and earn money from collecting their [manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure") - as they eat them (drop the flowers on the ground and let them feast, one at a time).

Your first priorities should be a [Pickaxe](/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe") and a [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch"), and if you have any spare flint, an [Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe"). Try to avoid straying into the [Deep Rainforest](/wiki/Deep_Rainforest "Deep Rainforest") for now, and instead search for a [Cave Cleft](/wiki/Cave_Cleft "Cave Cleft"). Inside, there is likely to be at least one [Stalagmite](/wiki/Stalagmite "Stalagmite"), which you should mine for more flint, rocks, and a gold nugget.

Back on the surface, make a Science Machine, a Hammer, and shears. Build yourself some essentials, such as a Log Suit, a Spear, and a Backpack. If you still have flint to spare, think about making a spare machete so that you won't run out of grass. Once you're done building everything, hammer the science machine and keep exploring.

## Day 2[]

Today should be spent exploring, as well as revisiting your spawn point to hammer the debris around it. Of specific note are the Deflated Balloon and the Monogrammed Luggage, for a free piece of cloth and a razor. If you come across the [Painted](/wiki/Painted "Painted") [Biome](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes"), explore it and pick up any gold and iron on the ground, while keeping a safe distance from [Gnat Swarms](/wiki/Gnat_Swarm "Gnat Swarm"). If you come across the [Cultivated](/wiki/Cultivated "Cultivated") Biome, make a note of it and keep exploring. Also, if you find a Peagawk near the edge of the map you can try and run it into a corner. The feathers can be made into a gas mask or traded.

## Day 3[]

Today, it's time to head into the city proper. Head through the cultivated biome and look for the slated turf and aristocratic pigmen. The pig civilization uses [Oincs](/wiki/Oinc "Oinc") as currency, and traders will give you oincs in return for certain items. The items they accept can be determined by their appearance. The best way to make money early on is to use your shears to trim [Hedges](/wiki/Hedge "Hedge") for [clippings](/wiki/Clippings "Clippings"), which can be exchanged with the [blond-haired pig](/wiki/Shopkeep "Shopkeep") in return for one oinc apiece with no cool-down. The razor can also trim hedges but the shears are better since they give twice as much. Another fairly efficient way of making money is to give refined goods, such as rope which can be farmed by killing hanging vines, to the [mechanic pig](/wiki/Mechanic_Pig "Mechanic Pig"). However, most traders only accept goods once a day, so it's important that you look for duplicate types of traders if you want to make a lot of money fast.

Once you've gotten about 50 oincs, look for [Swinesbury City Hall](/wiki/Swinesbury_City_Hall "Swinesbury City Hall"). In here, you can buy the [Deed of home ownership](/wiki/Deed_of_home_ownership "Deed of home ownership") to give yourself a safe haven: the [Slanty Shanty](/wiki/Slanty_Shanty "Slanty Shanty"), however it can be bad if you have more experience because it is far from important biomes, so i'd recommend making a base outside near important biomes like the [Lily pond](/wiki/Lily_Pond "Lily Pond") biome. If you haven't found it already, the deed can be read like a [Message in a Bottle](/wiki/Message_in_a_Bottle "Message in a Bottle") to reveal the location of the house. Inside the house, you are completely protected from darkness. Inside will be two pieces of charcoal on the floor, as well as a cinder-block shelf, a rope light, and a fish mounting. The mounting can be hammered to obtain one oinc as well as a raw fish, so it can be used in case of emergency as a food supply. Your deed should be placed somewhere safe outside of the Slanty Shanty. This is because if your Slanty Shanty is burned down, after rebuilding it, you will no longer be able to open it and will have to re-buy the deed, though all of your items and structures will still be inside.

Spend the rest of the day making more money, as there's another use for oincs that you should exploit tomorrow.

## Day 4[]

All around the city, you may notice a variety of shops. These shops will allow you to buy supplies in exchange for oincs, from food to rare items. Buy a couple healing items from the spa and cloth from the general store as it will be needed later to craft the gas mask and pith hat. If you have enough money you can also buy a bug net to catch fireflies for a mining hat. Gather other supplies, and build a science machine inside or near your home. Build some treasure-hunting tools, especially a ball-pein hammer, and start looking for artifacts and statues on the surface. The artifacts you can recover from inside can be given to the [museum keeper pigman](/wiki/Professor "Professor") for 10 oincs apiece, but more importantly you can find gold from the statues which will be needed to make an alchemy engine.

Remember, always build science structures inside the slanty shanty. When the humid season comes, lightning strikes will burn structures left in the open, but when *your* structures are destroyed, pigmen will not repair it, but they will repair a burnt slanty shanty with all of your structures inside intact.

## Days 5+[]

Once you have an alchemy machine, next make a crock pot and hopefully if you got pig skin from the vampire bats, a football helmet. With a log suit, helmet and a spear you can easily take on a lone pig guard. Fight the guard at dusk so he switches to a torch which deals much less damage. Or alternatively, when using MnK, with a little practice, one can hit the guard, then try giving him something he would politely refuse, temporarily canceling his attack swing, and hit him again following another give action, making a hit-less kill. Killing the guard will give you a halberd which is a nice weapon upgrade. Try a foray into the deep rainforest to hunt hanging vines for rope and snaptooth plants for vines (fully grown ones drop a stalk which you can dry into a stalking stick). When it is dusk kill weevoles for their shells so you can make a weevole mantle, along with dung beetles for their chitin. Prepare for [Humid Season](/wiki/Humid_Season "Humid Season") by making yourself a [Pith Hat](/wiki/Pith_Hat "Pith Hat"). Make sure to keep a steady supply of food and resources, and look for the ruins in the deep rainforest that lead to other islands.

Keep supplies for both season:

Foggy season: Waterproof hats and [Weevole Mantles](/wiki/Weevole_Mantle "Weevole Mantle") to counter the wetness and the slow effects of the Fog

On around day 10, you will see a giant flying shadow called the BFB. When it lands, you can let it eat you by avoiding it's feet and staying still if when the head is drifting towards you. However make sure to be prepared with a full stomach and a light source. If you want to despawn it, just run into town.

The BFB will take you to the pinacle biome where there's a stone egg which you can hatch into the equivalent of chester. There's also a royal scepter which can be given to the pig queen. You can escape through the sinkhole and exploring the cave, which will have a passage to one of the islands. If you are especially lucky this will take you straight to the island with the palace, where you can trade in your newly acquired scepter. You will then be able to obtain one of the royal gallery items which are all very powerful, however if you want to keep playing hamlet don't pick the silly string.

Also kill some spider monkies for their silk and beard hair. Grab the attention of one by getting close and lure it away from the pack, or into snaptooth plants. Use the silk to make a boomerang, which you can use to kill pigeons to get azure feathers. This will let you craft a Hogus Porkusator. Then use the beard hair to craft a meat effigy. This will put you in a good spot especially if you already have one of the royal gallery items.

#### Note[]

This guide was written fairly quickly to rectify the lack of a Hamlet guide. As a result, it's fairly bare-bones. Feel free to add any missing pieces of advice and correct any mistakes made.
