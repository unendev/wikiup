## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Her quote for a Pomegranate ("Eat that and you're stuck here forever!") and cooked Pomegranate ("It does look pretty tempting.") may be a reference to [the abduction of Persephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone#Abduction_myth "wikipedia:Persephone") from Greek mythology.
* Her quote for the Blue Moonlens ("It saw me standing alone.") is a reference to the song *[Blue Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Moon_(1934_song) "wikipedia:Blue Moon (1934 song)")* ("Blue moon you saw me standing alone").
* Her quote for the Purple Moonlens ("That's amore.") is a reference to the song *[That's Amore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That%27s_Amore "wikipedia:That's Amore")* which includes the line "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore".
* Her announcement quote for trying to offer something on the Altar of Gnaw when there's already something else there ("Ah, a wonderful bird, the peli-can.") is explained by a nearby speech file comment ("it’s beak can hold more than its belly-can!").
* Winona's comment for a Potato in *[The Gorge](/wiki/The_Gorge "The Gorge")* ("I just think they're neat.") is directly quoting Marge from *The Simpsons* in a scene that has become a popular meme.
* When examining [Fish](/wiki/Fish "Fish"), Winona will say, "I'd rather eat for a day than not at all." This is a reference to the [proverbial saying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/give_a_man_a_fish_and_you_feed_him_for_a_day;_teach_a_man_to_fish_and_you_feed_him_for_a_lifetime "wikipedia:give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"), "If you give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. Teach him to fish, and he'll eat for a lifetime."
* Her quote for missing a Lightning strike ("Ha! Now you gotta kiss me!") is a reference to the schoolyard taunt "Missed me, missed me, now you gotta kiss me!"
* Her quote for a Prestihatitator is a reference to the movie *The Emperor's New Groove*.
* The phrases "Leapin' Lena" from her examination quote for the Glossamer Saddle ("Still wouldn't keep up with a Leapin' Lena...") and "Tin Lizzie" from her examination quote for the Walking Cane ("It's no Tin Lizzie.") are old-fashioned nicknames for the [Ford Model T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T "wikipedia:Ford Model T").
* Her quote for the Dragonpie is a reference to fast food restaurant chain Wendy's advertisement campaign "Where's the beef?".
