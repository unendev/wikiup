The Petrifying Tome is an item added to The Forge in Don't Starve Together. Available immediately from Maxwell and Wickerbottom.

This item is a melee weapon. When attacking, the character swings the tome and deals 15 damage to the target.

Petrify Tome's main ability is Petrify: when used, all enemies caught in the area of effect are turned to stone for a long period of time, thus being unable to attack and move, which completely neutralizes them until they take damage: then the stone collapses and Enemies become aggressive.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* [Boarilla](/wiki/Boarilla "Boarilla"), [Grand Forge Boarrior](/wiki/Grand_Forge_Boarrior "Grand Forge Boarrior") and [Infernal Swineclops](/wiki/Infernal_Swineclops "Infernal Swineclops") do not turn to stone ([Rhinocebros](/wiki/Rhinocebro "Rhinocebro") can be turned to stone, but only while they are in a dream) when using the book, instead their limbs will be in stones for 2 seconds, which allows you to buy some time.
