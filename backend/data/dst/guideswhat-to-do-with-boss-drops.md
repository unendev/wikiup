Boss drops are items that are dropped by bosses. I will be talking about the following drops:

[Spider Hat](/wiki/Spider_Hat "Spider Hat"), [Living Logs](/wiki/Living_Logs "Living Logs"), [Bee Queen Crown](/wiki/Bee_Queen_Crown "Bee Queen Crown"), [Deerclops Eyeball](/wiki/Deerclops_Eyeball "Deerclops Eyeball"), [Guardian's Horn](/wiki/Guardian%27s_Horn "Guardian's Horn"), [Down Feathers](/wiki/Down_Feather "Down Feather"), [Scales](/wiki/Scales "Scales"), and [Thick Fur](/wiki/Thick_Fur "Thick Fur")/[Fur Tufts](/wiki/Fur_Tuft "Fur Tuft"). The SW boss drops are W.I.P.

This guide will not be about killing bosses. If one wants to learn about how to do so, please read [Guides/How to Kill the Giants](/wiki/Guides/How_to_Kill_the_Giants_in_DST "Guides/How to Kill the Giants in DST").

## Spiderhats[]

A spiderhat, the drop from the [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen"), cannot be crafted into anything. It is basically a form of turning into the spider-y aspect of [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") for a while (without the downsides).

Spiderhats should be used to do things Webber would do: recruit [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders") into making Spider wars, massing them for battle, etc.

Things the Spiderhat should NOT be used for:

* Simply using up it's durability to walk through a spider-infested area (one should try to take down the dens one by one).
* Engaging battle with Spiders, this defeats the whole purpose of the hat.
* Used for wetness resistance in [Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants"). (It's basically useless)

If the hat is at around 5% Durability, it should be taken out of the players' inventory until fixed with a [Sewing Kit](/wiki/Sewing_Kit "Sewing Kit").

## Living Logs[]

Living Logs should not be, at all costs, used for [Fuel](/wiki/Fuel "Fuel"). While it may have good(?) burn time, it really is a price to pay for not being able to get many [Magic Tab](/wiki/Magic_Tab "Magic Tab") items.

Anyways, Living Logs are dropped from ([Palm](/wiki/Palm_Treeguard "Palm Treeguard")) [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguards "Treeguards") (6), [Poison Birchnut Trees](/wiki/Poison_Birchnut_Tree "Poison Birchnut Tree") (2-3), and ([Jungle](/wiki/Regular_Jungle_Tree "Regular Jungle Tree"))[Totally Normal Trees](/wiki/Totally_Normal_Tree "Totally Normal Tree") (3).

When first getting your hands on your very first Living Logs, one should immediately get a [Shadow Manipulator](/wiki/Shadow_Manipulator "Shadow Manipulator"), only requiring 3 of them, a [Purple Gem](/wiki/Purple_Gem "Purple Gem"), and 7 [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel").

This will allow access to all of the Magic Items.

From there, one should build Magic Items based off of priority,

* A [Seaworthy](/wiki/Seaworthy "Seaworthy") should be built first if the player is in a RoG/SW Merged save slot.
* A [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword") should be built first if the player is planning on killing another Boss.
* A [Bat Bat](/wiki/Bat_Bat "Bat Bat") should be built first if the player has trouble getting health back from a fight.
* Never make a [Telelocator Staff](/wiki/Telelocator_Staff "Telelocator Staff") & [Focus](/wiki/Telelocator_Focus "Telelocator Focus") first! It is too costly!
* Make a [Glossamer Saddle](/wiki/Glossamer_Saddle "Glossamer Saddle") if the player somehow has all 68 [Butterfly Wings](/wiki/Butterfly_Wings "Butterfly Wings") to make it. It really does offset the time, but this should be made first only if the player is ready to take on the burden of maintaining a [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo").

When one is spelunking into the ruins, and finds the [Ancient Pseudoscience Station](/wiki/Ancient_Pseudoscience_Station "Ancient Pseudoscience Station"), one should make the [Deconstruction Staff](/wiki/Deconstruction_Staff "Deconstruction Staff") first, alongside a [Construction Amulet](/wiki/Construction_Amulet "Construction Amulet"). It (just barely) allows renewability if using RoG, and allows a much larger stockpile of unrenewable items if playing the base game.

## Bee Queen Crown[]

Obtaining this item is long and tedious. One should be very careful with this item.

It's main use is how it turns [Insanity](/wiki/Insanity "Insanity") auras into [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") auras.

When you obtain the crown, one can do the following:

* Stand near an evil flower, and gain as much sanity as standing directly near [Glommer](/wiki/Glommer "Glommer") does (25 spm)(spm = Sanity Per Minute)
* Wearing both [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword") and [Night Armor](/wiki/Night_Armor "Night Armor") (gaining 30 spm)
* Standing near a passified Treeguard (100 spm)
* Standing near a Spider Queen (400 spm) (as Webber)

Please do not stand around other players wearing the item, as it's a very angering thing to do, making other players bow, unable to do anything. Please also note that the item's durability is based on the amount of hits it takes, so the player can achieve 100 spm without having to repair the Crown.

Be mindful around hostile creatures. Don't make them attack you with the crown on, or it loses durability. It shields 70% damage, but it isn't really good as an armor piece.

## Deerclops Eyeballs[]

Deerclops Eyeballs are the product of killing the [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops"). It should never be eaten. NEVER. It's stats can be recreated fairly easily with a simple [Dragonpie](/wiki/Dragonpie "Dragonpie") and [Healing Salve](/wiki/Healing_Salve "Healing Salve") Mix, and gives +20 more sanity.

The eyeball can be used for crafting, alternatively.

The first Eyeball should be used for the [Eyebrella](/wiki/Eyebrella "Eyebrella"), and should be made to combat the [rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") and [heat](/wiki/Heat "Heat") of [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring") and [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") respectively. If the Eyebrella is down to around 5%, it should be taken off, and repaired with a Sewing Kit.

All the other Eyeballs should be used for [Houndius Shootius](/wiki/Houndius_Shootius "Houndius Shootius"), which will help you in the long run with [Hounds](/wiki/Hounds "Hounds") and possibly making a Hound Farm with a [Varg](/wiki/Varg "Varg").

## Guardian's Horn[]

This item is dropped from the [Ancient Guardian](/wiki/Ancient_Guardian "Ancient Guardian"), and acts similarily to the Deerclops Eyeball. But it still, should not be eaten. The Guardian spawns only **ONCE**. Thus, it should immediately be turned into a Houndius Shootius.

## Down Feathers[]

Down feathers are dropped from [Moose/Goose](/wiki/Moose/Goose "Moose/Goose") and her [Moslings](/wiki/Mosling "Mosling").

If the player has already aquired the Eyebrella, then the player should make the [Weather Pain](/wiki/Weather_Pain "Weather Pain"). It causes constant damage to stun-lockable [Creatures](/wiki/Creatures "Creatures"), and causes mass destruction in small areas. Also, it can safely hatch a [Moose/Goose Egg](/wiki/Moose/Goose_Egg "Moose/Goose Egg") from a distance, resulting in more Moslings, resulting in more feathers. Probably the most useful thing the player can do with the Weather Pain is farm living logs. The Weather Pain can destroy a Poison Birchnut Tree in one use, leading to an average of ~37.5 living logs gathered with one Weather Pain.

If the player does not have an Eyebrella, or has already made 3 Weather pains, one should make a [Luxury Fan](/wiki/Luxury_Fan "Luxury Fan"). It cools down the player very heavily, and extinguishes all fires nearby. If the player is playing [Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together"), and is playing on a [Year of the Gobbler](/wiki/Year_of_the_Gobbler "Year of the Gobbler") save, then Luxury fans and Weather Pains should both be saved until the player has ran out of [Lucky Fans](/wiki/Year_of_the_Gobbler "Year of the Gobbler").

## Scales[]

Scales are the boss drops from the [Dragonfly](/wiki/Dragonfly "Dragonfly"). Note that [Scaled Chests](/wiki/Scaled_Chest "Scaled Chest") and [Scaled Flooring](/wiki/Scaled_Flooring "Scaled Flooring") are pretty much useless once the player builds [Ice Flingomatics](/wiki/Ice_Flingomatic "Ice Flingomatic"). [Scalemail](/wiki/Scalemail "Scalemail") isn't as great for [Willow](/wiki/Willow "Willow") in the base game, but comes in handy for her in DST, due to fire invulnerability. Scalemail in general though, comes in handy when dealing with [Fire Hounds](/wiki/Fire_Hounds "Fire Hounds"), but shouldn't be used around [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbirds "Tallbirds"), as they may burn their own [Tallbird Nests](/wiki/Tallbird_Nest "Tallbird Nest"). Scalemail can also be used similarly to [Fire Staffs](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff"), stunning enemies.

Scales' other power is [Scaled Furnaces](/wiki/Scaled_Furnace "Scaled Furnace") in DST. They are a large source of heat in winter, to the point that a player can die of overheating during [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), if standing directly by it. The furnace is also everlasting, not requiring fuel and will always be ready to warm you up at your base camp.

## Thick Fur/Fur Tufts[]

Thick Fur/Fur Tufts (DST) are the drops from the [Bearger](/wiki/Bearger "Bearger"). The [Insulated Pack](/wiki/Insulated_Pack "Insulated Pack") is pretty much useless, as an [Ice Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester") is a cheaper, better version of the pack. Also, [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly") gets a [Chef Pouch](/wiki/Chef_Pouch "Chef Pouch"), which is basically a reskin of the pack.

The [Hibearnation Vest](/wiki/Hibearnation_Vest "Hibearnation Vest") is a [Beefalo Hat](/wiki/Beefalo_Hat "Beefalo Hat") for your body slot. Wearing both with a full [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") [Beard](/wiki/Beard "Beard") with a [Thermal Stone](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone") gives you the highest insulation factor of 735, equivalent to about 1 & 1/2 days without requiring warmth. This basically means that you'll have no problem with warmth during Winter. Please note that if the vest reaches around 5%, take it off immediately and use a sewing kit to fix it.

Fur Tufts are very tedious to pick up and avoid the Bearger's attacks. The player shouldn't worry about getting all 90 tufts, and should gradually get the tufts as more Beargers come. If you somehow get all 90 tufts, treat yourself to 3 extra Thick Furs.
