*Reign of Giants* Summer depicted in a promotional image.

 

Summer lasts for 15 days from day 56 to 71 with default world settings. The surface world takes on a yellow-orange tint which changes in brightness periodically (as opposed to the blue tint of winter) and little pollen/dust motes appear in the air. Sound effects and music are frequency filtered to sound thin and disant.

Days are much longer in Summer, nights average length, and Dusk the shortest, lasting just one segment during mid-season. Longer days make daylight-related [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") less of an issue than in other seasons.

[Red Hounds](/wiki/Red_Hound "Red Hound") appear during periodic [Hound](/wiki/Hound "Hound") waves in summer. They present a severe fire danger to bases (they ignite when killed) and are an important source of [Red Gems](/wiki/Red_Gem "Red Gem"), which are relatively rare until the first summer.

Overheating, wildfires, and Antlion's disturbances combine to make Summer the most challenging season of the game on the surface world.

## Overheating[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating")*

Similar to [freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") in the Winter, an unprotected player will suffer damage from [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") in Summer. There are many strategies to "beat the heat" such as standing in the shade of a leaf-bearing [tree](/wiki/Tree "Tree"), carrying a cooled [Thermal Stone](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone"), or wearing an [Eyebrella](/wiki/Eyebrella "Eyebrella"). Some characters are more sensitive to heat ([Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie")) while others ([Willow](/wiki/Willow "Willow") or [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") in bloom) are less so.

## Wildfires[]

The Summer season is marked by severe drought, and items will periodically [ignite](/wiki/Fire "Fire"). Wildfires occur only during the day, on the surface world, outside the Oasis desert and not under fully-grown [Knobbly Trees](/wiki/Knobbly_Tree "Knobbly Tree").
When the world temperature is above 80 degrees, every 45 seconds, burnable objects within 6¼ pitchfork tiles (25 wall-units) of any player attempt to catch fire. There is a 20% chance that this attempt will succeed. This includes plants, such as [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush"), mobs, and even structures like the [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine"). [Lureplants](/wiki/Lureplants "Lureplants") have a higher smoldering priority than other items. Some items, like [Rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks") and [Pearl's Pearl](/wiki/Pearl%27s_Pearl "Pearl's Pearl") are fireproof and will never smolder or catch fire.

An object nearing its combustible point will smolder and visually smoke for a few seconds before igniting. The player's character will comment on it when it is examined. Fires will cause nearby flammable objects to smolder, then ignite, quickly spreading the fire.

Wickerbottom's [Pyrokinetics Explained](/wiki/Books#Pyrokinetics_Explained "Books") might be the quickest and most thorough way of extinguishing fires, but individual smoldering objects can be manually extinguished by clicking on them (causing 3-5 damage). Other practical fire extinguishing methods include the [Ice Flingomatic](/wiki/Ice_Flingomatic "Ice Flingomatic"), [Watering Can](/wiki/Watering_Can "Watering Can"), [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff"), or even applying Ice or [Fertilizer](/wiki/Fertilizer "Fertilizer").

When Structures have been burnt down, players can hammer them down to recover half the components, including single components.

Objects only combust when near the player during daytime and may be protected by simply staying away from them until Autumn.

It is common for players to spend the summer or even base somewhere that fires are not a problem, such as the Oasis, the Caves, or under fully-grown [Knobbly Trees](/wiki/Knobbly_Tree "Knobbly Tree"). The Oasis provides no protection against overheating, but the other areas do.

## Wetness and Plants[]

Most summers will pass without any rain whatsoever, but rain is still possible and some summers have 1 or 2 short rain events (that are not started by the player). High heat and no rain results in world moisture quickly reaching zero.

Small plants ([Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling"), [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft"), etc.) will wilt in the dry heat, but can be returned to normal with water or [Fertilizer](/wiki/Fertilizer "Fertilizer"). [Watering Cans](/wiki/Watering_Can "Watering Can") are particularly helpful for garden moisture, but balloons, a [Fire Pump](/wiki/Fire_Pump "Fire Pump") or even [Spittlefish](/wiki/Ocean_Fishes#Spittlefish "Ocean Fishes") will water anything smouldering, or on fire, wetting the ground beneath it. Ice flingomatics will keep saplings and shrubs from wilting, but do not water garden crops, though they constantly throw snowballs at them. [Dragon Fruit](/wiki/Dragon_Fruit "Dragon Fruit") plants are immune to wilting and smoldering.

Groups of pine trees will petrify during summer, providing a renewable source of rocks, flint, and occasional other minerals at the cost of available wood.

Non-petrified plants return to normal a few days into [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn"), even without fertilizer. Fertilized crops will grow faster due to longer daylight but not as fast as during a moist spring, unless given supplementary moisture.

## Caves[]

In the caves, Spring, Summer, and Fall are indistinguishable except by the total rainfall which is highest in Spring, near-zero in Summer, and moderate in the Fall. This makes summer an ideal time to explore the caves or ruins as thermal protection can be completely ignored and wetness protection is usually unneeded. Cave bases and gardens benefit from 100% wildfire and overheating protection if the survivor can mitigate the sanity drain of the low light.

## Spoilage[]

During Summer, food spoils 25% faster.

## Oasis Desert[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, the Oasis Desert undergoes the biggest changes during summer. [Antlion](/wiki/Antlion "Antlion") emerges on the first dry day (to cause sinkholes on the surface and cave-ins in the caves). A [Sandstorm](/wiki/Sandstorm "Sandstorm") covers the entire Oasis desert when the environment is dry, reducing survivor movement speed and visibility. [Cactus](/wiki/Cactus "Cactus") will yield [Cactus Flowers](/wiki/Cactus_Flower "Cactus Flower") when picked during Summer.

## Tips[]

* A [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter") can be worn all summer in the caves without overheating and will even give a slight positive sanity boost beyond counteracting the low-light sanity drain of the caves.
* [Knobbly Trees](/wiki/Knobbly_Tree "Knobbly Tree") can be grown on the surface and bases built under them to completely eliminate overheating and wildfires under their 7-9 tile diameter of shade. Wildfires can still start outside this radius and Above-Average Tree Trunks can burn, so an Ice Flingomatic or aware survivors with watering cans and ice staffs are still highly recommended. These trees can be grown 7-8 tiles apart to cover wide areas of the surface world with shade. Small areas like [Hermit Island](/wiki/Hermit_Island "Hermit Island") and parts of the [Lunar Archipelago](/wiki/Lunar_Archipelago "Lunar Archipelago") can be completely shaded this way.
* An [Eyebrella](/wiki/Eyebrella "Eyebrella") or even [Umbrella](/wiki/Umbrella "Umbrella") provides excellent heat protection for short periods of time.
* Woodie is more vulnerable to overheating than other characters. He may want to seek shelter under several closely-planted trees during the day, then run to the caves on the first evening to remain underground until Autumn.
* Lureplants smolder sooner than anything else. Placing them just inside the ice flingomatic radius will concentrate all smoldering on the plant which the flingomatic will extinguish. This effectively adds a smolder-free radius around the lureplant to extend the flingomatic's range. This does not extinguish fires outside the flingomatic's original range, just prevents smoldering from starting there.

# Don't Starve Don't Starve[]

There are only 2 seasons and **Summer** there works just like Autumn in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") worlds have different seasonal variations.

# https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f8/Reign of Giants icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20140408110712 Reign of Giants[]

The [Dragonfly](/wiki/Dragonfly "Dragonfly") can occasionally be encountered. It will roam around the landscape, setting nearby structures on fire. [Verification Needed]
