Wormwood's main perk is access to the exclusive [Green Thumb Tab](/wiki/Green_Thumb_Tab "Green Thumb Tab"). This gives him the ability to craft 5 unique items. These items are:

* **[Living Log](/wiki/Living_Log "Living Log")** – Used in making Poison balm, Bramble Husk, and Bramble Trap. Costs 20 Health to craft. Also used in a number of recipes that aren't specific to Wormwood.
* **[Poison Balm](/wiki/Poison_Balm "Poison Balm")** – Cures [Poison](/wiki/Poison "Poison").
* **[Bramble Husk](/wiki/Bramble_Husk "Bramble Husk")** – When worn: provides protection, deals damage to all [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") around Wormwood when he is hit, and prevents damage from [Brambles](/wiki/Bramble "Bramble") and Bramble Traps.
* **[Bramble Trap](/wiki/Bramble_Trap "Bramble Trap")** – Works similarly to a [Tooth Trap](/wiki/Tooth_Trap "Tooth Trap"), dealing less damage but to all mobs in the area around the trap rather than to one target.
* **[Compost Wrap](/wiki/Compost_Wrap "Compost Wrap")** – Restores 30 Health.

Wormwood can plant [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") and [Crop Seeds](/wiki/Crop_Seeds "Crop Seeds") without a [Farm](/wiki/Farm "Farm"). Seeds planted this way take four days to grow fully, and they yield the same foods that they would if grown on a farm. He can plant seeds on most turfs, excluding things such as [Rocky](/wiki/Rocky_Turf "Rocky Turf") Turf, [Checkerboard Flooring](/wiki/Checkerboard_Flooring "Checkerboard Flooring"), and [Volcanic](/wiki/Volcano_Turf "Volcano Turf") Turf. These plants look the same as if grown on farms, and if burned before reaching full growth they yield [Cooked Seeds](/wiki/Seeds#cooked "Seeds").

Wormwood gains 10 Sanity from planting most [Plants](/wiki/Plants "Plants"). This includes [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") and [Crop Seeds](/wiki/Crop_Seeds "Crop Seeds") planted on the ground, on a [Farm](/wiki/Farm "Farm") or [Improved Farm](/wiki/Farm#Improved "Farm"), planting [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft"), [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling"), [Bamboo Patches](/wiki/Bamboo_Patch "Bamboo Patch"), [Viney Bushes](/wiki/Viney_Bush "Viney Bush"), [Nettle Vines](/wiki/Nettle_Vine "Nettle Vine"), [Coffee Plants](/wiki/Coffee_Plant "Coffee Plant"), [Spiky Bushes](/wiki/Spiky_Bush "Spiky Bush"), [Tree](/wiki/Tree "Tree") seeds, or placing crafted [Claw Palm Saplings](/wiki/Claw_Palm_Sapling "Claw Palm Sapling"). He can also get this sanity boost by digging through a [Dung Pile](/wiki/Dung_Pile "Dung Pile") without a [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel"), giving him a total of +30 Sanity per pile. Planting [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterflies "Butterflies") does not give him sanity.

He can fertilize himself with [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure"), [Guano](/wiki/Guano "Guano"), or [Bucket-o-poop](/wiki/Bucket-o-poop "Bucket-o-poop") to regain 2 Health. A Bucket-o-poop can be used this way five times, for a total of 10 Health.

No [Food](/wiki/Food "Food") item changes his health in any way, so items such as Monster Lasagna can be consumed without taking any damage.

[Snaptooth](/wiki/Snaptooth "Snaptooth") Seedlings, Snaptooth Flytraps, [Hanging Vines](/wiki/Hanging_Vine "Hanging Vine"), and [Eyeplants](/wiki/Eyeplant "Eyeplant") are neutral towards him. Snaptooth enemies will still attack Wormwood if he carries any meat items (including eggs) too close to them, so caution should be taken.

Wormwood blooms in [Spring](/wiki/Seasons/Spring "Seasons/Spring"), [Monsoon Season](/wiki/Seasons/Monsoon "Seasons/Monsoon") and [Lush Season](/wiki/Seasons/Lush "Seasons/Lush") in three stages, gaining a faster walking speed and higher hunger drain depending on the stage. This effect increases until 2/3 of the way through the season, when his blossom will close up and he reverts to his normal form during the last 1/3 of the season.

| Stage | Movement Speed Multiplier | Hunger Drain Multiplier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 1.06 | 1.33 |
| 2 | 1.13 | 1.66 |
| 3 | 1.2 | 2 |

Wormwood's blooming transformation during Spring, Monsoon Season, or Lush Season.

 

During the third stage of blooming, Wormwood's flower will open up and a small particle effect of pollen will begin to fall from his head. In addition to this, everywhere he steps in this form will begin to grow small tufts of grass and flowers. This trail of flowers and grass is more than cosmetic, however, and will attract Bees. This generally results in them attacking Wormwood due to their more aggressive Spring or Monsoon form, so caution should be taken. The bees may play the animation as though pollinating these flowers, but they will not generate honey using them. It should be noted that while the flowers are only visible during the peak of Wormwood's blooming phase, Bees are attracted to him throughout all of Monsoon, Spring, and Lush season.

Wormwood is immune to [Hay Fever](/wiki/Hay_Fever "Hay Fever"), which usually comes during the Lush Season.

## Disadvantages[]

As said above, Food items will neither increase nor decrease Wormwood's health. This limits the usefulness of items such as [Dragonpie](/wiki/Dragonpie "Dragonpie") and [Pierogi](/wiki/Pierogi "Pierogi"), restricting him to non-edible healing items.

In addition, Wormwood loses Sanity when most plants near him are destroyed within a five-tile radius, even if the damage is not caused by him.

* -2 Sanity from burned trees, flowers, seeds, saplings and grass tufts. Saplings, grass tufts, and tree seeds will cause sanity loss even if burned as an item on the ground. The amount of items in the stack does not change the sanity drain.
* -2 Sanity from trees, saplings or grass tufts being knocked over or uprooted by things such as the [Hippopotamoose](/wiki/Hippopotamoose "Hippopotamoose")'s jumping attack or the stomp from the [Old Bell](/wiki/Old_Bell "Old Bell").
* -5 Sanity from picking [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") or digging up tree stumps, Grass Tufts, Saplings, Coffee Plants, Bamboo Patches, Viney Bushes and Nettle Vines.
* -15 Sanity from chopping down a tree at any growth tier, including burned trees.

There is no sanity drain associated with some plants, such as [Weathered Trees](/wiki/Weathered_Objects "Weathered Objects"), [Ferns](/wiki/Fern "Fern") and [Spiky Bushes](/wiki/Spiky_Bush "Spiky Bush").

Wormwood also catches fire more easily than other characters. Wormwood is able to be frozen by the [Ice Flingomatic](/wiki/Ice_Flingomatic "Ice Flingomatic") in a similar way to mobs. It will take two projectiles from the Ice Flingomatic in quick succession to freeze him. Wormwood is also vulnerable to the effects of Smoldering in [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer"), although this is very rare.

In *Hamlet* worlds, he spawns near three [Rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks") and four [Ancient Walls](/wiki/Wall "Wall") instead of the [Hot Air Balloon](/wiki/Hot_Air_Balloon "Hot Air Balloon") (which could otherwise be [hammered](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer") for resources). There is still a [Machete](/wiki/Machete "Machete") nearby.

## Prototype Tips[]

* Using his ability to grow large amounts of food, Wormwood can sleep in a [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent") or [Siesta Lean-to](/wiki/Siesta_Lean-to "Siesta Lean-to") to regenerate large amounts of health all while still having food to spare.
* Because of his high sanity variability, Wormwood can easily use equipment like the [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword"), [Bat Bat](/wiki/Bat_Bat "Bat Bat") and especially the [Night Armor](/wiki/Night_Armor "Night Armor"). Lost Sanity can easily be re-obtained. Otherwise, Wormwood can quickly induce himself high insanity if need be.
* Although Eyeplants are neutral to him using force attack still targets them. Caution is advised.
* You can craft a Bucket-O-Poop and use it to heal more than you would with the initial 3 Manure.
* Since [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") don't need to be fertilized, and planting them gives +10 Sanity while digging them up only gives -5 Sanity, Wormwood can easily gain Sanity by repeatedly digging up and re-planting the same Sapling for a net +5 each time.
* Though Wormwood can control his sanity completely through planting and chopping/digging/picking things, he can end up in situations without sufficient seeds/shovels. It is still sometimes more practical or even necessary to restore sanity with food or other standard means.
