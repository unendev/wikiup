**Emotes** are a type of [Curio](/wiki/Curio_Cabinet "Curio Cabinet") in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* that allows the player to have their character perform an action by typing the corresponding command into the chat. Several commands can be used by default, such as: /happy, /angry, /no, /bonesaw, /dance, /facepalm, /joy, /kiss, /pose, /rude, /cry, /wave, /sit, /squat, /toast, /pet, and /bigpet. Some of these commands (such as dance, sit, and squat) are looped and will continue playing until the characters move or are hit.

[Domesticated Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo#Domestication "Beefalo") also have their own set of emotes when mounted by a character; likewise, [Woby](/wiki/Woby "Woby") has her own emotes when mounted by [Walter](/wiki/Walter "Walter"). The mounts will mimic whatever emote the player types in the chat. However, mounts don't have pose or wave emotes, so they will simply stand still when the player uses those commands.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

Wilson performing the 'Dab' emote

 

* The emote /bonesaw and its alternate commands (/ready, /goingnowhere, /playtime, /threeminutes) are a reference to the 2002 *[Spider-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2002_film) "wikipedia:Spider-Man (2002 film)")* film. The commands originate from quotes by the character Bonesaw McGraw: "Bonesaw is ready!" and "Hey freak show! You're going nowhere. I got you for three minutes. Three minutes of playtime."
* When Maxwell's shadow puppets are idling, they do the same emotes as Maxwell.
* There is an unused '[Dab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dab_(dance) "wikipedia:Dab (dance)")' emote in the animation files used for one of Klei's [tweets](https://twitter.com/klei/status/806637129065381888) that can be activated, like all other player animations, using commands in the [Console](/wiki/Console "Console"). The command is: `ThePlayer.AnimState:PlayAnimation("emote_dab_pre")or "emote_dab_loop" or "emote_dab_pst"`
* The Sleepy Emote's old description was "*You are getting very sleepy...*"
* The /toast emote was added during the Winter's Feast event of 2019.
* The Yawny Jammies Ensemble used to be called the Purple Jammies Ensemble.
* The /rude emote resembles the [Bras d'honneur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bras_d%27honneur), a rude gesture most common in Romance-speaking parts of the world.
