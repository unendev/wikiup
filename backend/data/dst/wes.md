–**Wes**

**Wes** is one of the two playable [Characters](/wiki/Character "Character") that are not unlocked via [Experience](/wiki/Experience "Experience") in *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* and one of the 17 playable characters in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* (DST). He is a fragile French mime that uses pantomimes to communicate instead of speaking. Wes's purpose in the game is to provide a challenge to experienced players.

## Minimap Maxwell's Door Origin[]

**“**Some people just seem to attract more than their fair share of bad luck... and even those people are grateful they aren't Wes.**”**

–Official description for *C'est La Vie*

 File:Don%27t Starve Together- C%27est La Vie -Wes Animated Short- 

Don't Starve Together- C'est La Vie -Wes Animated Short-

 

Wes's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled *[C'est La Vie](/wiki/Animated_shorts_and_trailers#C'est_La_Vie "Animated shorts and trailers")*. An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium"):

*Despite a life plagued by terrible luck, Wes has never been one to utter so much as a word of complaint. Rather than dwell on his own troubles, he has instead dedicated his life to making others smile... even if it's at his own expense.*

*His journey to the Constant itself was nothing if not a tragic comedy of errors. After a series of snowballing missteps, Wes found himself accidentally taking the place of a stranger caught in the grip of a shadowy portal bound for the Constant. His unexpected arrival infuriated the Nightmare King, who quickly exacted his vengeance on the poor mime for interfering with his plans. Wes was banished to his own private prison, far from sight, where he would remain until he was rescued by the Constant's other Survivors (being the kind soul that he is, Wes holds no grudge against Maxwell... though he does continue to give him the silent treatment.)*

*Had Wes known what fate awaited him on his last day on Earth, he likely wouldn't have done anything differently. In truth, there is a part of him that is happy to be in the Constant with the other Survivors - for who could be in greater need of cheering up than those poor souls?*

According to the passport on the table at the girl's house and the box marked with the name in the lower right corner, the stranger who was replaced by Wes was [George T. Witherstone](/wiki/Minor_Characters#George_T._Witherstone_and_daughter "Minor Characters"), the former creditor of William Carter. This also explains why Maxwell angrily imprisoned Wes after he failed to retaliate.

[WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") in an effort to rescue Wes.

 

In the third chapter of [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"), a set piece may appear (if the map is not *Two Worlds*), which will have two chambers with a [Maxwell Statue](/wiki/Maxwell_Statue "Maxwell Statue") in each one, and a third one with Wes in the middle.

When players break one of the statues, it will release various non-damaged [Clockwork Monsters](/wiki/Clockwork_Monsters "Clockwork Monsters"). After breaking all the statues and defeating the Clockwork Monsters, go to the chamber where Wes is trapped. More Bishops, Knights and Rooks will spawn and the player will need to defeat them.

After all monsters are cleared, Wes will pass out, fall on the ground, and disappear. Wes will then be unlocked as a playable character.

In *Don't Starve Together*, Wes is available to play from the start, with no unlocking required.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

### In-Game[]

 File:Don%27t Starve Together A 1st For Everything Wes Animated Short 

Don't Starve Together A 1st For Everything Wes Animated Short

 

* Wes was added in the *[Insanity!](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve/Version_History#Insanity! "Don't Starve/Version History")* update on February 12, 2013.
* Wes was made unlockable through Adventure Mode, in *[The End of the Beginning](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve/Version_History#The_End_of_the_Beginning "Don't Starve/Version History")* update.
* Wes used to be the sixth unlockable character via [Experience](/wiki/Experience "Experience").
  + Wes is currently one of six characters that cannot be unlocked by gaining Experience, the others being [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(character) "Maxwell (character)"), [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber"), [Wilbur](/wiki/Wilbur "Wilbur"), [Woodlegs](/wiki/Woodlegs "Woodlegs"), and [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba").
* The Pile o' Balloons was added in the *[Strange New Powers](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve/Version_History#Strange_New_Powers "Don't Starve/Version History")* update.
* In singleplayer version of *Don't Starve*, Wes has higher maximum Sanity than [Willow](/wiki/Willow "Willow"), [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid"), Webber, and Woodlegs, and higher maximum Health than Maxwell and [Wheeler](/wiki/Wheeler "Wheeler"). All his stats are higher than a non-upgraded [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78").
* When struck by [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning"), Wes is shown to have bones in his hair.
* In RoG, the Pile o' Balloons can be given to a [Catcoon](/wiki/Catcoon "Catcoon") to befriend them, but this is not advised as to get them back the Catcoon must die and similar results can be achieved with simple [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs").
* Instead of using an actual paddle, Wes pantomimes one to move [Boats](/wiki/Boats "Boats") in the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC.
* When *[The Gorge](/wiki/The_Gorge "The Gorge")* event first began, Wes's Culinarian skin was missing his red cheeks. This was later fixed in an update.
* In *Rhymes with Play* #201, it was revealed that Wes's Victorian skin was to have a soot cloud effect when he walked. This was not implemented as it would have made the skin more complex and thus more valuable compared to the others.
* For April Fools' Day 2020, Wes was given a fake character rework along with an [animated short](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#A_1st_For_Everything "Animated Shorts and Trailers").[[1]](#cite_note-1)
* Wes is the only character whose favorite food can only be cooked in [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly")'s [Portable Crock Pot](/wiki/Portable_Crock_Pot "Portable Crock Pot").
* His idle animation is blowing a red balloon, which audibly pops, surprising him.
  + Ironically, despite being a silent character, he is the only character so far to have an audible idle animation.
* Wes will still say "I can't do that" when attempting to do an impossible action (this is corrected in Don't Starve Together icon).
* Wes's original pantomime movements were animated by Alex Savin.[[2]](#cite_note-2)
* During the preview stream for *[A Little Rain Must Fall](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve/Version_History#March_12th.2C_2013_-_A_Little_Rain_Must_Fall "Don't Starve/Version History")*, developers said that Wes has an invisible bicycle, a likely reference to his cycling action.[[3]](#cite_note-3)
* Additional pantomimes were added to DST for Wes's [refresh update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History#April_1.2C_2021_-_Wes_Character_Update "Don't Starve Together/Version History").
* According to *Rhymes with Play* #279, the pantomime in which Wes waves both his hands is based on the American Sign Language (ASL) sign for applause.
* The pantomime in which Wes puts a hand to his forehead and looks around is recycled from an animation for the [Crabby Hermit](/wiki/Crabby_Hermit "Crabby Hermit") Don't Starve Together icon.
* Wes is the only character without an actual quote
* In *Don't Starve Together*'s *[A Little Drama and QOL](/wiki/A_Little_Drama_and_QOL "A Little Drama and QOL")* update, the game files include dialogue strings for Wes's soliloquy. These are never seen normally in-game since he is coded never to access dialogue strings. The text is in French, and translates to "Are you trying to understand my thoughts? How kind of you! I am flattered. :)"

### Lore[]

* Wes's birthday is listed as April 16 in the [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium"). This date is observed as [World Voice Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Voice_Day "wikipedia:World Voice Day"). It is also the birthdate of silent film star [Charlie Chaplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin "wikipedia:Charlie Chaplin").
* According to the description for Wes's Roseate skin, he feels "his rosy cheeks [are] his best feature.".
* According to the description for his Verdant skin, Wes is an "avid landscape painter.".

### Cultural References[]

* In the Valentine's Day card for 2018, it appears that Wes is using the American sign language (ASL) sign for "[love](https://www.handspeak.com/word/search/index.php?id=1316)".
* Wes's Guest of Honor skin may be based on a man's ballet outfit. This could be a reference to ballet mime.
* Wes's Victorian skin may be based on Bert from the Disney film *Mary Poppins*. Bert was played by Dick Van Dyke, who performed a mime act early in his career. [[4]](#cite_note-4)
* Wes's Pierrot skin is based on Pierrot, a stock character in the French pantomime and form of clown.
* Wes's Magmatic skin is based on a bullfighter's uniform. In addition, the design takes inspiration from the titular character of *[The Scarlet Pimpernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Pimpernel "wikipedia:The Scarlet Pimpernel")*, a novel by Baroness Orczy. The name of the individual skins call him the "Sulphur Pimpernel". Also, the skin's flavor text describes him as a dandy by day and a "swordsmime" by night, not unlike the Scarlet Pimpernel himself.
