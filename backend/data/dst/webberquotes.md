## Placeholder Trivia[]

* His quote for a Dead Dogfish ("All dogfish go to heaven, right?") is a reference to the film *[All Dogs Go to Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Dogs_Go_to_Heaven "wikipedia:All Dogs Go to Heaven")*.
* When examining a [Butter Muffin](/wiki/Butter_Muffin "Butter Muffin"), Webber says, "Do you know the muffin spider?", which is a reference to the nursery rhyme *[The Muffin Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muffin_Man "wikipedia:The Muffin Man")*.
* When Webber inspects the [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff"), he says, "We didn't start the fire," which is a reference to [a song of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Didn%27t_Start_the_Fire "wikipedia:We Didn't Start the Fire") by Billy Joel.
* Upon inspecting a Burnt Tree, Webber states "Only we can prevent forest fires." This is a reference to [Smokey Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokey_Bear "wikipedia:Smokey Bear").
* When inspecting a [Thulecite Club](/wiki/Thulecite_Club "Thulecite Club"), Webber says, "We will, we will, smash you!" This is probably a reference to "[We Will Rock You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Will_Rock_You "wikipedia:We Will Rock You")" by Queen.
* When inspecting [Maxwell's Door](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door"), Webber says, "Something wicked this way comes", likely a reference to the same saying in the play *[Macbeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth "wikipedia:Macbeth")* by Shakespeare.
* When inspecting a [Grave](/wiki/Grave "Grave"), Webber says "My loot sense is tingling." This may be a reference to Marvel's superhero [Spider-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man "wikipedia:Spider-Man"), who has a "spider sense".
* Webber's quote for examining a [Spear](/wiki/Spear "Spear"), "We should stick things with the pointy part", is a reference to the TV show *[Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones "wikipedia:Game of Thrones")*.
* When examining an [Extra Smelly Durian](/wiki/Extra_Smelly_Durian "Extra Smelly Durian"), Webber will say, "No sir, I don't like it", which is a reference to a *[The Ren & Stimpy Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ren_%26_Stimpy_Show "wikipedia:The Ren & Stimpy Show")* character named Mr. Horse.
* When examing a burning Grass Tuft, Webber will say "Fire Fire Fire!", which may be a reference to what all playable classes in *Team Fortress 2* say when they are burning, except for Pyro.
* Upon inspecting a Roasted Birchnut, Webber will say "Roasted on an open fire." This is a reference to "[The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christmas_Song "wikipedia:The Christmas Song")".

* Inspecting the [Moggles](/wiki/Moggles "Moggles"), Webber will say "I can see for miles and miles", which is likely a reference to The Who's "[I Can See for Miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Can_See_for_Miles "wikipedia:I Can See for Miles")".
* Examining an [Old Bell](/wiki/Old_Bell "Old Bell") will lead Webber to say "Exactly the right amount of bell". It is possible that this is reference to Christopher Walken's well-known performance in the *Saturday Night Live* sketch "[More Cowbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Cowbell "wikipedia:More Cowbell")".
* Upon examining a [Crabbit](/wiki/Crabbit "Crabbit"), Webber says that since it only has 6 legs, it is not a spider and thus "not a friend". This is technically true since real-life spiders have eight legs, but Spiders in *Don't Starve* only have six legs like a Crabbit.
* Inspecting a [Purple Moonlens](/wiki/Moonlens "Moonlens"), Webber will say "Now we won't need to leave a trail of breadcrumbs!", which is a reference to the well known fairy tale *[Hansel and Gretel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel "wikipedia:Hansel and Gretel")*, in which the protagonists leave a trail of breadcrumbs to follow back to their home.
* Upon examining a [Petrified Evergreen](/wiki/Petrified_Tree "Petrified Tree") Webber will say "It's all stone and no bark." The [bark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark "wikipedia:Bark") is the hard outermost layer of tree trunks, and the quote itself may be a play-off of the commonly-used idiom "All bark and no bite".
* When examining a [Gigantic Beehive](/wiki/Gigantic_Beehive "Gigantic Beehive"), Webber will say "Oh, bother!". This is a possible reference to Walt Disney's *[Winnie the Pooh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_the_Pooh "wikipedia:Winnie the Pooh")*.
* When examining a [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen"), Webber says "Mommy-longlegs?" This may be a reference to the common nickname for large spiders, which is "Daddy-longlegs".
* His reaction to a violent Winona player ("Don't do hits, %s!") may be a reference to the *[My Brother, My Brother and Me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Brother,_My_Brother_and_Me "wikipedia:My Brother, My Brother and Me")* episode "Tarantulas & Travis Did a Hit".
