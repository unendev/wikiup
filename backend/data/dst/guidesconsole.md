To access the cheat screen is very simple. You do not need to download any programs "recommended" to do this, you just need a working mouse and a downloaded and bought version of [Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve"). You only need to do these few steps once and throughout all the old versions and current to new versions, you do not need to ever do this step again.

1. Hit Start Button on the bottom left side of the screen
2. Click on "Documents" on the right side of the window that popped up.
3. Double click on the "Klei" folder
4. Double click on "DoNotStarve"
5. Double click on "settings"
6. Change `ENABLECONSOLE = false` to `ENABLECONSOLE = true`
7. Launch Don't Starve

Press enter once to enter the code. if the screen does not add any text, you put it in correctly, if the screen adds text, then you have to put it in again correctly.to exit the screen at any time, press the ~ key once again. To go back to a previous cheat, press the up arrow and change it to your liking or the correct way. Pressing ENTER will submit what you currently have. If ever you want to clear all the text once you exit the cheat box, press CTRL+L, this will clear up the entire text. When you open the box again, however, the text will reappear. These cheat boxes work on every Character and some cheats require two steps (AKA two different inputs). More will be described when necessary

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/50/Cheat... Spawn In Enemies 1.png/revision/latest?cb=20130812043806 



 

Info: This cheat spawns in the preferred amount of mobs you want, but some of them have a different name, such as the [Treeguard](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard") being called the leif because in the coding of the game treeguard is mentioned as leif. If you want to know what all the names are for some mobs, you can check on the World editor screen where you can mouseover the few mobs listed. These mobs are the most common next to the birds. The other way is to visit this wiki and search up the specific types of animals or creatures from the mob page. To enter this code you need to type code one in first, then hit enter, and type in the second code, changing prefab to the mod and amount to how much you want.

| Code 1: RunScript("consolecommands") Code 2: c\_spawn("prefab", amount) | Result: Spawns in the preferred mob and how many you wished to have |
