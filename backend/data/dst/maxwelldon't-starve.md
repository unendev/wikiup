Maxwell fragmenting his mind.

 

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Codex Umbra](/wiki/Codex_Umbra "Codex Umbra")*

Maxwell's Sanity increases by 20 Sanity/min because of his dapper style. He starts the game with a [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword"), [Night Armor](/wiki/Night_Armor "Night Armor"), [Purple Gem](/wiki/Purple_Gem "Purple Gem"), 4 [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") and his own Book called the [Codex Umbra](/wiki/Codex_Umbra "Codex Umbra").

Codex Umbra acts similar to [Wickerbottom's](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom") [books](/wiki/Books "Books"), but has an infinite durability. Upon reading it, a Shadow Puppet with the silhouette of Maxwell will appear. Using the Book costs 15 Health, 2 Nightmare Fuel and 55 maximum Sanity. Due to this the player may have up to 3 puppets, at which point Maxwell will have 35 Sanity and will be unable to spawn more. The Shadow Puppets will live up to 2.5 days before dying off. They will aid Maxwell in combat, and assist him in [mining](/wiki/Category:Mineable_Objects "Category:Mineable Objects") and chopping down [Trees](/wiki/Category:Trees "Category:Trees"). Upon death of a Puppet, Maxwell's maximum sanity will be restored by 55 points.

## Disadvantage[]

Maxwell's maximum Health is only 75, making fights very dangerous if the player doesn't have good armor available. His Sanity regeneration bonus can also make it hard to stay insane and reap the benefits of that state.

In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* (SW) DLC, Maxwell's Puppets will aid him when hacking things with a [Machete](/wiki/Machete "Machete") and they will have their own shadow version of the [Row Boat](/wiki/Row_Boat "Row Boat") making it possible for them to follow him across islands, unlike other [Followers](/wiki/Followers "Followers").

## Prototype Tips[]

* Maxwell's starting items are some of the most powerful and rare in the game giving him an easier start than most. The Armor and Sword provide a great deal of survivability.
* Summoning multiple Puppets to reduce the maximum Sanity is a good way to get Maxwell to stay almost insane for long periods of time, which is not easily obtained normally due to his Sanity regain buff. Coupled with the fact that when equipping his Sword and Armor he loses 10 Sanity/min, it is possible for him to become insane and sane back at will and very easily since there's only 5 points of sanity between the two thresholds.
  + Going insane during [Daylight](/wiki/Day "Day") and killing [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures") for Nightmare Fuel is a good way to keep his Puppets up 24/7 during the early days of the game. Killing [Beardlings](/wiki/Beardlings "Beardlings") (or bearded [Crabbits](/wiki/Crabbit "Crabbit") in SW) is also an option but Nightmare Fuel from them is not always guaranteed.
* Since Maxwell has a natural regeneration of Sanity, players are recommended to do sanity-consuming things that other players would suffer from. For example: picking [Evil Flowers](/wiki/Flower#Evil_Flower "Flower"), using [Magic](/wiki/Magic "Magic") and [Ancient](/wiki/Ancient "Ancient") [Items](/wiki/Items "Items"), or eating sanity draining [Food](/wiki/Food "Food").
  + Sanity regenerating items such as the [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter"), [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent"), [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy") etc. are unnecessary for Maxwell. This allows him to wear armor such as the [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet") while still rapidly regaining Sanity. This also makes exploring during the [Night](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle") or in [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") and [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") ideal as the Sanity drain from darkness is negated.
* Due to Maxwell's low max Health, it is recommended to use his starting Night Armor when fighting dangerous creatures such as [Hounds](/wiki/Hounds "Hounds") or [Boss Monsters](/wiki/Boss_Monsters "Boss Monsters") early on, reducing damage against him by 95% when worn.
  + Combined with his Dark Sword and Shadow Puppets, Maxwell is unexpectedly an ideal fighting character before the durability of the Armor and Sword wear out.
* While Shadow Puppets are great against weaker foes, fighting stronger Mobs will result in their death unless they're helped by Maxwell. Great support weapons are the [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff") and [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff"). The Ice Staff can be used to stun enemies before they land a hit on the Puppets, preventing them from taking damage. The Fire Staff can stun mobs for longer while also damaging them but comes at the cost of possibly burning the dropped loot upon the enemy's death.
  + Players can also take advantage of the behavior of [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") to get the most out of the Puppets. (e.g. Getting a [Tallbird](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird") to aggro on Maxwell first, then ordering the Puppets to attack it.)
* Maxwell also has the advantage of being capable of building a [Shadow Manipulator](/wiki/Shadow_Manipulator "Shadow Manipulator") quicker than other characters, as he starts with a Purple Gem and Nightmare Fuel, shortening the time needed for gathering materials. This can allow players to quickly rebuild Night Armor and Dark Swords early in the game.
* Normally the Shadow Puppets stop aiding with their Tools after Maxwell stops doing the act, but if they are close to the target and the player quickly cancels the action by moving or quickly switching to another hand slot item, [the Puppets will still carry it out](https://cdn.streamable.com/video/mp4/rnly.mp4), essentially getting the resources without using the durability of the Tool. This means that it is a waste of resources to craft better versions of those Tools when playing as Maxwell.
* Late game, players can collect Nightmare Fuel in mass amounts by staying in the Ruins during the [Nightmare Cycle](/wiki/Nightmare_Cycle "Nightmare Cycle"). [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures") can drop stacks worth of fuel for the player to collect once the cycle reaches its calm state.
  + Otherwise dropping some captured bees near some [Evil Flowers](/wiki/Evil_Flowers "Evil Flowers") will spawn more of the latter which then can be used to craft Nightmare Fuel.
* Due to the low maximum Health and the cost of the Codex Umbra it is advised to only rely on [Life Giving Amulets](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet") to revive from death instead of [Meat Effigies](/wiki/Meat_Effigies "Meat Effigies") as the latter will leave him at only 45 maximum Health. This means that [Beard Hair](/wiki/Beard_Hair "Beard Hair") is largely useless to Maxwell.
* In DLCs, thanks to his Sanity regeneration, Maxwell will not lose Sanity even with 100 [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") while holding wet [Items](/wiki/Items "Items").
