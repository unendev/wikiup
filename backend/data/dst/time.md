In-game day timer

 

Using the default settings, an in-game [Day-Night Cycle](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle") or "day" has sixteen 30-second segments and lasts 8 real-world minutes. [Seasons](/wiki/Seasons "Seasons") have different lengths: Summer and Winter each last 15 days, Autumn and Spring last 20, making an in-game year 70 in-game days or 9 1/3 real-world hours.

| Game Unit | Game Time | Real Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Segment | 1/16 day | 30 sec |
| Day | 16 segments | 8 min |
| Winter/Summer | 15 days | 2 hrs |
| Autumn/Spring | 20 days | 2 hrs 40 min |
| Year | 70 days | 9 hrs 20 min |

Recurring processes in the game tend to happen every second, 10 seconds, or day.
