**“**I AM A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH!**”**

–**Walani**

**Walani** is one of the four playable [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") exclusive to the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC. She is the eighth Character to be unlocked via [Experience](/wiki/Experience "Experience"), with 2240 XP. She is a surfer with a relaxed personality.

Walani begins the game with her custom [Surfboard](/wiki/Surfboard "Surfboard"). The Surfboard does not require hands to row, and can be a great tool for exploration early on. In addition to drying faster, she also gets hungry slightly faster than normal and effects over time on her [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") are slightly weaker. Her maximum [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") is only 120 but her [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") is 200, making up for the faster drain to it. Overall, Walani fills the role of an easy-to-use starting Character for *Shipwrecked.*

## Placeholder Trivia[]

### In-Game[]

* Walani was added to *Don't Starve: Shipwrecked* in the *[Hang Ten](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked#December_17.2C_2015_-_Hang_Ten_Update "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* update on December 17, 2015. She was the first Character to be added to the DLC during its Early Access phase.
* Walani's voice is played by an (out-of-tune) ukulele.
* When struck by [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning"), Walani has bones in her hair (similar to most other *Don't Starve* Characters) as well as in her gold earrings.
* Her old nickname was "The Relaxed", and her old motto was "Can someone bring me some food?"
* When traveling via surfboard, unique music plays instead of the default sailing track.[[1]](#cite_note-1) Making her one of only a few characters to have unique music tracks tied their perks.
* After being asked about Walani's inclusion in *DST* on February 8th, 2020 Joe W stated it's in the realm of possibility, but that they've decided to not work on it as of yet due to concerns about releasing more existing content.[[2]](#cite_note-2)

### Lore[]

* Walani is most likely Hawaiian or of Hawaiian descendants as she has smaller eyes, a rounder nose, and darker skin than all other characters apart from [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly"). Her name also gives this away, as ending in -lani is a very common compound name in Hawaiian culture. Similar names exist, such as *Wailani* which means heavenly water, fitting her love of the ocean. Surfing is also a common Polynesian archetype. That would make her the first and only Polynesian character, as well as the first character that isn't either Eurocentric or Inhuman added to the franchise.
* Walani's attire (gold hoop earrings, ruffle shirt, and buccaneer boots), along with examination quotes for certain items such as the [Cutlass Supreme](/wiki/Cutlass_Supreme "Cutlass Supreme"), [Captain Hat](/wiki/Captain_Hat "Captain Hat"), and [Swordfish](/wiki/Swordfish "Swordfish") suggest that she may formerly have been a pirate before giving it up to become a surfer.
* Walani seems to have a fear of being alone in the dark, heavily panicking in all her quotes related to darkness. [[3]](#cite_note-3)
* Walani may have had a negative experience with jellyfish, as her examination quote states that she "hates [those] things".
* Dragoon saliva reminds Walani of her brother. ("My brother used to do the same thing.")
* Walani suggests she prefers herbal medicines, judging by her quote for the [Brain Cloud Pill](/wiki/Brain_Cloud_Pill "Brain Cloud Pill"). ("I only take herbals...")
* Walani's home has a lot of makeshift furniture judging by her quotes for Cinderblock Bookshelf, Crates Shelf, Pallet Shelf, and Crate Table ("I have this in my place at home.")
