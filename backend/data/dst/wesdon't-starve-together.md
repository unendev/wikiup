`"wes"`

In *Don't Starve Together*, Wes has lowest stats of any survivor across the board, all of them having the maximum of 75 points. Much like in the singleplayer version of the game, he is able to inflate [Balloons](/wiki/Pile_o%27_Balloons "Pile o' Balloons") that once popped can deal a little amount of damage to entities that are nearby. Each inflation costs 5 Sanity, and there is no limit to how many balloons Wes can inflate. In addition, he can craft a variety of equipment in the [Balloonomancy Tab](/wiki/Balloonomancy_Tab "Balloonomancy Tab").

Differently from *Don't Starve*, Wes's hunger drain rate is equal as that of other characters.

## Disadvantages[]

Due to his misfortune, Wes suffers from more disadvantages when compared to the *Don't Starve* version. While retaining the damage output penalty, he is more susceptible to overheating and freezing, and takes more time to recover from grogginess (e.g. upon and after [awakening](/wiki/Sleeping "Sleeping") or when being slowed down by attacks). Hounds will also prioritize attacks on Wes when there are other players in the server, and Wes is distinctly more likely to get targeted by them when other players are nearby. [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") strikes are more likely to smite him.

Wes is less efficient while using tools when [chopping](/wiki/Axe "Axe"), [mining](/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe") and [hammering](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer"). Because of this, the tools used will not wear out as fast as with other characters. This also applies to weapons because of the damage output penalty.

Just like in *Don't Starve*, Wes does not speak, so there are no actual words that show up on the screen, warning the player of incoming attacks or other pertinent information (although he will still perform his usual miming animation should he be holding still). The player will usually only be able to rely on audio cues or other characters' quotes in these situations. This also means he is unable to [speak to crops](/wiki/Farm_Plant#Happiness "Farm Plant") or read the [Fish Scale-O-Matic](/wiki/Fish_Scale-O-Matic "Fish Scale-O-Matic").

## Prototype Tips[]

Wes surrounded by his balloons.

 

* Balloons can be used to lure Mobs to traps or to other hostile Mobs.
* Weapons that deal indirect damage, such as the [Fire Dart](/wiki/Fire_Dart "Fire Dart") or [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder"), are not affected by Wes's low damage multiplier, making them excellent choices for him.
* Boating can be very good for Wes. [Wonkey/Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Wonkey/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Wonkey/Don't Starve Together") is a big upgrade for Wes, giving him more Sanity, Hunger, and more than double the Health at the cost of angering [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") and [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") and losing an inventory slot. If Wes is using [Night Armor](/wiki/Night_Armor "Night Armor") for its 95% protection, [Monkeytails](/wiki/Monkeytails "Monkeytails") make harvesting [Reeds](/wiki/Reeds "Reeds") much easier. Grabbing [Underwater Salvageables](/wiki/Underwater_Salvageable "Underwater Salvageable") with a [Pinchin' Winch](/wiki/Pinchin%27_Winch "Pinchin' Winch") is much safer than raiding the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins").
* A [Belt of Hunger](/wiki/Belt_of_Hunger "Belt of Hunger") will nullify Wes's Hunger drain and also provide a boost to Sanity, although a [Backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") can't be equipped while wearing it.
* A [Funcap](/wiki/Funcap "Funcap") can similarly compensate for Wes's Hunger drain and provides 60 heat resistance in summer, but is probably less valuable than an armored helmet.
* [Soothing Tea](/wiki/Soothing_Tea "Soothing Tea")'s 30 seconds of sanity boosts can keep Wes sane through at least the beginning of boss fights, though it's rapid spoilage timer and the difficulty of reliably farming [Forget-Me-Lots](/wiki/Forget-Me-Lots "Forget-Me-Lots") make this more practical after acquiring [Bundling Wrap](/wiki/Bundling_Wrap "Bundling Wrap") which means defeating [Bee Queen](/wiki/Bee_Queen "Bee Queen").
  + In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, the [Hibearnation Vest](/wiki/Hibearnation_Vest "Hibearnation Vest") also provides a Hunger drain reduction, as well as the highest insulation against [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") and more than twice the Sanity regeneration of the Hunger Belt.
  + It's not efficient to eat food that restore more than 75 hunger (such as [Meaty Stew](/wiki/Meaty_Stew "Meaty Stew")), as the extra hunger points will be wasted.
* In *Don't Starve Together*, Wes's [favorite food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Fresh Fruit Crepes](/wiki/Fresh_Fruit_Crepes "Fresh Fruit Crepes"), meaning he gains 15 bonus Hunger when consuming it.
  + However, Fresh Fruit Crepes already restores 150 Hunger and Wes's maximum Hunger level is 75 Hunger. Because of this, unless they're spoiled, the player can't get any benefit from the bonus. While spoiled, Fresh Fruit Crepes will provide Wes with 65 Hunger, at the cost of losing 15 Sanity.
  + In addition, the dish can only be created using a [Portable Crock Pot](/wiki/Portable_Crock_Pot "Portable Crock Pot"), which means that it is impossible for Wes to obtain without a [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly") present.
