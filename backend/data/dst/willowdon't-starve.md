Willow and her lucky Lighter.

 

Willow starts with her exclusive item, Willow's Lighter. The Lighter functions similarly to a [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch"), but with infinite [Durability](/wiki/Durability "Durability") and a lower light radius. It can be used to set objects on fire and provides light that can be used to survive the night without being attacked by [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie").

Willow is immune to fire. In addition, close vicinity to fire will gradually restore Willow's sanity. The larger the fire, the more Sanity is regained up to 10 Sanity per minute. Willow must stand close to a fire to receive the effect, but her fire immunity allows no risk in doing so.

## Disadvantages[]

Though Willow is immune to fire damage, she is not immune to Overheating. She can easily overheat from too much fire and care should be taken to avoid or allocate for this when dealing with fire or performing strategies that involve fire.

When Willow is at 60 or less sanity, she will randomly light a small fire at her feet without warning, and say "Tee Hee!", "I made a fire!", "I just can't help myself!", or "Oops." The small fire is capable of spreading and setting important structures (including the player's base) and objects on fire. Caution is advised when at low sanity with Willow.

## Tips[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Guides/Character guide-Willow](/wiki/Guides/Character_guide-Willow "Guides/Character guide-Willow")*

* There is no cap to the amount of sanity/min that Willow can gain from multiple fires. So the player can drop multiple flammable items nearby ( [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), [Logs](/wiki/Logs "Logs") etc.) and then set them on fire to gain massive amounts of sanity and warmth. Note that a single stack counts as a single fire, so any items will need to be dropped separately.
  + On the console version, the drop command can be used to drop all items in the same spot as separate stacks. With enough items, sanity can be instantly restored.
  + This is only really worth it in versions of the game where one can construct an [Ice Flingomatic](/wiki/Ice_Flingomatic "Ice Flingomatic"), which can preserve the items at little cost.
* An Ice Flingomatic can help prevent base fires caused by Willow's low sanity.
* Due to her immunity to fire, Willow can set ablaze items in her inventory to regain sanity, get warm, produce a large light radius bigger than all other portable sources, and/or do serious damage to any mob susceptible to fire close by. Care must be taken to avoid getting close to flammable objects while doing this.
  + [Saplings](/wiki/Saplings "Saplings") or [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tufts "Grass Tufts") have a nearly 30 second burn time, making them ideal for this strategy. Once more, a stack that's on fire counts as a single fire, regardless of its size.
  + A flaming stack of items can be extinguished by combining it with another stack (even if that stack is on fire as well). However, combining a non-flaming stack with a flaming stack will do nothing.
* Other light sources are still important. Torches, the [Miner Helmet](/wiki/Miner_Helmet "Miner Helmet") and the [Lantern](/wiki/Lantern "Lantern") are still necessary for situations where a flaming item can cause unwanted fires, but a larger light source than the lighter is needed.
