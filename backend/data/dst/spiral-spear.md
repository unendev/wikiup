The **Spiral Spear** is an item added to *[The Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge")* in *Don't Starve Together* (an unlockable item in the 2018 Crucible). Dropped by the last enemy of wave 9.

This item is considered a melee weapon. When attacking, a character swings the spear and deals 30 damage to the target.

The main ability of the spiral spear is a strike from the sky (**Sky Lunge**). When used, a character soars up and appears at the selected point, dealing area damage to all enemies.

The Warcry character (Wigfrid's special ability) has a second special ability for this item: he makes 5 quick hits, dealing 38 damage each.

## Prototype Tips[]

* This melee weapon drops in the late waves, with strong opponents, so it is desirable to have good armor in addition to it.
* With the help of a blow from the sky, you can not only attack enemies, but also get out of a dangerous situation by choosing a place far from the battlefield.
* It's best for Wigfrid not to use the Spiral Lance when the healer is about to place a lifebloom under the Great Hog Furnace Warrior, as it may trigger a warcry and cause the boar to fall asleep later and even kill someone.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* In the 2018 event, this weapon was unlockable following the DST Community's victory over Svinorillas via the Summoning Tome.
