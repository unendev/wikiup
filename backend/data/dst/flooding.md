*Exclusive to:* Shipwrecked

**Flooding** is a mechanic introduced in the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* DLC. Areas become flooded during [Monsoon Season](/wiki/Monsoon_Season "Monsoon Season") by Puddles, and [Beach](/wiki/Beach "Beach") biomes are regularly flooded by encroaching Tides during nighttime. Walls do not block flooding. Flooding of both types will induce [wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness"), and slow down the player. It is suggested to have water resistant gear (such as a [Snakeskin Hat](/wiki/Snakeskin_Hat "Snakeskin Hat") and [Snakeskin Jacket](/wiki/Snakeskin_Jacket "Snakeskin Jacket")), if one must traverse into flooded areas. [Birds](/wiki/Birds "Birds") won't land on flooding tiles, and will swiftly fly away if they already land and the flooding spreads. In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")* DLC, [Nettle Vine](/wiki/Nettle_Vine "Nettle Vine") will grow if planted in Flooding [Dense Turf](/wiki/Dense_Turf "Dense Turf").

## Tides[]

**Tides** cause water to cover [Beach](/wiki/Beach "Beach") near the shore, moving in after night falls and receding after the morning starts. Tides grow bigger each night but move furthest in during the [Full Moon](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle"), and are absent during new moons. Tides will replenish [Seashells](/wiki/Seashells "Seashells").

## Puddles[]

**Puddles** appear during [Monsoon Season](/wiki/Monsoon_Season "Monsoon Season"). They are initially small but increase in size and number as the season goes on, eventually covering most of the land. Puddles will not spawn on tiles covered with Crafted [Turfs](/wiki/Turfs "Turfs"), but expanding Puddles will still flood them. Puddles will dry up by the third day of [Dry S](/wiki/Dry_Season "Dry Season")[eason](/wiki/Dry_Season "Dry Season").

Puddles initially spawn in a cloverleaf shape, with the "eye" of the puddle and four surrounding puddle tiles. The puddle spreads out from the eye in a diamond/rectangle shape, growing with each wave of rain. The "eye" can be identified by tracing a line diagonally from one corner to its opposite, and finding the center tile. This "eye" can be "killed" using a Sandbag, no matter how big the puddle has become. (see Sandbags section paragraph 2).

## Sandbags[]

Both puddles and tides can be slowed or contained by placing **[Sandbags](/wiki/Sandbag "Sandbag")** in front of them. With practice, flooding can be “steered” a bit in this manner, allowing drier beach access and protecting Structures. If needed, one technique (albeit expensive) is to use Sandbags to absorb the water from flooded tiles, then hammer them back down to expose the dried land.

With puddles, a more economical strategy is to kill the "eye" before the Puddle starts spreading. Placing the Sandbag on the puddle "eye" tile will absorb the water from it, and permanently kill it for that monsoon season, stopping its spread. Any remaining puddle tiles can then be dried with additional sandbags.

A puddle will continue to expand in any direction which isn't blocked by a sandbag, and given enough time it will seep around a row of sandbags. Completely encircling a puddle will stop it from further expansion. Since there will be puddles everywhere, a better strategy may be to encircle small dry areas instead, and either covering them in Crafted Turf, or keep a sharp eye out for the occasional eye. This way the encircled area will not be accessible. Breaking a sandbag makes it accessible again, but a broken sandbag does not block puddles to expand. One way to fix this problem is encircling an area by the coastline, and access this area by boat.
