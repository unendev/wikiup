Warly cooking all four of his unique dishes in Portable Crock Pots.

 

Warly begins his adventure with a Portable Crock Pot; in addition to the functions of a normal [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot"), it can cook four special food items: [Sweet Potato Soufflé](/wiki/Sweet_Potato_Souffle "Sweet Potato Souffle"), [Monster Tartare](/wiki/Monster_Tartare "Monster Tartare"), [Fresh Fruit Crepes](/wiki/Fresh_Fruit_Crepes "Fresh Fruit Crepes"), and [Mussel Bouillabaisse](/wiki/Mussel_Bouillabaise "Mussel Bouillabaise"). The Portable Crock Pot can be carried around and placed at any time, so Warly does not have to build a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") in order to cook his meals. In addition, Warly starts with a [Chef Pouch](/wiki/Chef_Pouch "Chef Pouch") that doubles the life of Food items placed in it; he also knows its crafting recipe (1 [Cloth](/wiki/Cloth "Cloth") and 1 [Rope](/wiki/Rope "Rope")).

Warly gains 33% more Hunger, [Health](/wiki/Health "Health"), and [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") from Crock Pot meals, letting him regain more Health and Sanity than other Characters from those meals. If the food would reduce any of these attributes, the amount is decreased by 33% instead.

## Disadvantage[]

In addition to a 33% faster hunger drain, Warly gains only 70% of the Hunger, Sanity, and Health from raw foods, 80% from dried foods, and 90% from foods cooked over fire. If the food has negative effects on these attributes, the effect is increased by 30%, 20%, and 10% respectively instead. Ideally, his food should always be cooked in a Crock Pot, which can take valuable time depending on what was cooked.

Additionally, Warly likes variety in his diet. He remembers all food items eaten for 1.75 days since the last time they are eaten; if he eats the Food items that he remembers eating, he only gains a percentage of his normal Hunger, Sanity, and Health granted by the Food [Item](/wiki/Item "Item"), while the negative effects are amplified by the same percentage. The percentage depends on how many times the food item is eaten before it is forgotten. The first repetition of the food item applies 10% penalty, the second 20%, the third 35%, the fourth 50% and finally the fifth repetition applies 70% penalty on the food values. Any further repetition does not increase this penalty.

## Prototype Tips[]

* The following tips can be applied to both SW and DST:
  + Thanks to the Chef Pouch's ability to extend the time food can be carried before it spoils, Warly can travel long distances without worrying about going hungry. He can also afford to bring meals that have higher benefits but lower spoilage times.
  + If the Portable Crock Pot is not needed for a time, it can be used as a temporary marker on the map.
    - Warly can make more Portable Crock Pots in *Don't Starve Together*, allowing for more permanent map markers.
* Since the penalty for eating the same meal in a row goes away after 1.75 Days, Warly can cook a cycle of [Meaty Stew](/wiki/Meaty_Stew "Meaty Stew"), [Bacon and Eggs](/wiki/Bacon_and_Eggs "Bacon and Eggs") and even [Meatballs](/wiki/Meatballs "Meatballs") without changing his diet. Said dishes are extremely filling and do not require intensive ingredient gathering.
* The variety penalty is treated as a multiplier when stacked with other penalties. For example, if Warly eats two of the same dried item, the second meal will only give 64% of the normal benefits.
* Between the penalties for eating other foods and the bonuses from Crock Pot meals, Warly should always try to cook his meals in a Crock Pot. Make sure to consider the cooking times when preparing his food.
* While the Chef Pouch ingredients require a [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") to prototype, they are also possible drops from [hammering](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer") [Crates](/wiki/Crate "Crate"), making it possible to create additional Chef Pouches without a Science Machine.
