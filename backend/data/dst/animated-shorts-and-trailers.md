## Forbidden Knowledge[]

## Don't Starve Cinematic Trailer: Forbidden Knowledge

Wilson Preview

### Starring

[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")  
[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell/NPC "Maxwell/NPC")

### Release date

February 26, 2013

### Running time

1:39

### Links

[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0QhvmisGWU)

***Forbidden Knowledge*** is the first animated short released for *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* and is the origin story of how [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") became trapped in [Maxwell's Dimension](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant").

This trailer was originally found at the end of a [puzzle campaign](/wiki/Forbidden_Knowledge_Trailer_Puzzle "Forbidden Knowledge Trailer Puzzle").

### Placeholder Trivia[]

* When Wilson is holding the radio up in the *Forbidden Knowledge* cinematic (~00:40), there is a [hidden link](http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/eureka.html)  that leads to a page with the machine that Wilson built. Clicking on the machine's lever will turn the machine on and go to a page with concept art on the *Don't Starve* website, along with a message from Maxwell. The concept art page is no longer active, but an archived version is found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20130319113220/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/gallery/concept-art).
* The various images that fly around Wilson while he is being given "forbidden knowledge" by Maxwell include a Tie Fighter and the Death Star from *Star Wars*, an illustration of [Gamera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamera "wikipedia:Gamera"), various words such as "KLEI", mathematical formulas, molecular structure of caffeine, a [Gundam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam "wikipedia:Gundam")-like mech, and a [Vitruvian Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man "wikipedia:Vitruvian Man") featuring Wilson.
* The ending shot of Wilson being taken by shadow hands was nominated in the 42nd Annie Awards for Outstanding Achievement, Character Animation in a Video Game.[[1]](#cite_note-1)
* Upon starting a game in the PlayStation 4 version of *Don't Starve, Wilson's origin will play, however the scene where Wilson cuts his hand is skipped to the part where he drips the blood into the beaker.

***Next of Kin*** is an animated short featuring [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona"). It was released as part of her character refresh for *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* on March 7, 2019.

### Placeholder Trivia[]

* The Voxola worker that Winona saves in the short was named by DST writer Kris during *Rhymes with Play* #228. Her name is Genevieve but goes by Genny (specifically with a "G").
* A more complete view of the conspiracy board was (perhaps unintentionally) shown during *Rhymes With Play* #229.
* On the conspiracy board, you can see a lot of details, including for short films that had not yet been released at that time.
  + For example, you can see a poster from part 5 of the Willam Carter puzzle, Charlie's image from part 8 of the puzzle, a scene from the short film "The Amazing Maxwell - The Final Act".
  + You can also see Charlie's letter for Winona
  + You can see Woodie's missing message, Wendy's flower, and WX-78's diagram.
  + You can see the message about the fire in the library from the short film about Wickerbottom, as well as the portal on the checkered floor from the short film about Wes.
  + Also on the board is an article about some statements by Voxola, a world exhibition, and an excerpt from a conspiracy article on which the text "Secrets your Government won't tell you" is visible.
  + On the full version shown on Rhymes With Play #229, you can see a message about the loss of Wickerbottom, as well as that the conspiracy article touches on the Clockwork Bishop topic
* In the opening of the *Next of Kin* short, the upper half of a letter from Charlie addressed to Winona can be briefly seen. The whole letter was visible in *Rhymes with Play* #229.
  + :   *Dear Winona,*

***Possessions*** is an animated short released for the debut of [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox") in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* on March 28, 2019.

### Text[]

*Krampus and Wortox traipsed through the woods,*

*In the hopes to ruin goodness by being no good.*

*They both schemed with glee bearing grins of a fiend,*

*Oh you’re right, they’re quite wrong— they meant to be mean.*

*With their bounty of loot the haul was never enough,*

*Oh, what fun, to make glum by stealing one’s stuff.*

*But cruel-hearted fun still requires a heart,*

*And that’s where our two scoundrels drifted apart.*

*You see, mischief and malice is a line drawn quite thin,*

*And Wortox told Krampus: “This is where this one must end.”*

*Battling one’s nature is a most vicious affair,*

*But virtue gives vigor so that one might make a good tear!*

*And though Wortox felt better to have helped on the whole,*

*His fiendish half was still cursed to ensnare this foul soul.*

*So be careful what you wish for, a lesson worth mentioned,*

*For taking that which is not yours, can lead to possession.*

### Placeholder Trivia[]

* All backgrounds have been hand painted.

### Placeholder Trivia[]

* The short was made in 3-4 weeks. [Verification Needed]
* The scene where Willow picks up Bernie and the camera torns in to her face was not made in 3D. To get such a scene, Willow spun in place, and the background (created specifically for such a scene) went from right to left, while at the same time the illusion that the camera rotated 90 degrees.
* At 1:10 you can see [Willow's lighter](/wiki/Willow%27s_Lighter "Willow's Lighter")

***Along Came A Spider*** is an animated short featuring [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber"). It was released alongside Webber's character refresh in *Don't Starve Together* on June 24, 2021.

### Plot[]

The short begins in a sunny countryside house, where we see a human boy catch a butterfly he found stuck in a spider's web. Meanwhile, at the house, the boy's father receives a strange object from who is presumably Wagstaff before driving off in his van. The man takes it into his workshop, and as the boy tries to show him the butterfly he caught the man refuses, having work to do, and locks the door. The boy tried over and over again to get his father to spend some time with him, but he always remained holed up in his workshop, performing science experiments on the strange object. The boy eventually became filled with jealous thoughts, and decided to turn to being naughty to get attention.

One night, the boy sneaks into his parent's room, steals the key to the workshop from his father's bedside table, and walks up to the strange object before pushing it over. It shatters on the floor, scattering broken glass around and crackling with dark energy. As the boy turns to leave, however, the tarp moves aside to reveal what the strange object was - a glass case containing a Spider. The spider lunges at the boy, crackling with energy, and he blacks out.

Upon his regaining of conscious, the boy wakes up, but notices that he is covered in black fur, strangely. Webber then sees his reflection in one of the shards of glass, and to his horror, he and the spider have become one. Webber tries to sneak back into his room, but his parents arrive, woken up by the noise and coming to investigate. Thinking Webber is a monster, they scream and chase Webber out of the house and into the woods. As it begins to rain, Webber takes shelter under a fallen tree and bursts into tears, promising they would never be naughty ever again and wishing there was a way for them to split apart again. The camera then pans up to the cloudy sky, and lightning strikes, forming Maxwell's face for a second.

***The Incredible Strongman*** is an animated short featuring [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang"). It was released alongside Wolfgang's character refresh in *Don't Starve Together* on December 16, 2021.
In the trailer, a performance by the Abernethy & Parker Circus is shown, the circus which [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang") used to perform for. Different acts are shown performing, culminating in Wolfgang showing off his strength to the crowd by apparently lifting an entire elephant. However, a small mouse spooks Wolfgang and causes him to jump away, revealing that the elephant he had purportedly been holding had actually been held up by a lifting platform which Wolfgang's body was blocking from view. The crowd boos Wolfgang, and he is dismayed.

Later, as the circus travelling in their circus wagon train, Wolfgang is shown honing his strength with weights in his wagon car. The circus wagon suddenly breaks down as they are crossing some railroad tracks, and as the circus members try to get their elephant out of the stuck car, a passenger train suddenly comes barreling down the tracks and crashes into the circus wagon. The video cuts to Wolfgang when he wakes up among the destruction, and he notices a man trapped under one of the train cars. Wolfgang rushes over to try and help the man and as the strongman is straining to lift the burden a pair of Shadowy tendrils shoot out from a [book](/wiki/Codex_Umbra "Codex Umbra") on the ground and cause Wolfgang's muscles to grow extra large with enhanced strength. With this extra power, Wolfgang is able to throw the entire traincar off of the man (who is shown to be [William Carter](/wiki/Maxwell_NPC "Maxwell NPC")), and the Shadowy tendrils rush out of Wolfgang and back into the book which is now in the rescued man's hands. The man looks distressed at being caught holding the shadow book, as the video ends with him turning and running away.

This trailer depicted the events that had been described in the [fourth William Carter puzzle](/wiki/William_Carter_Puzzles#Fourth_puzzle "William Carter Puzzles") years before, and revealed that Wolfgang had been the one to rescue [William Carter](/wiki/Maxwell_NPC "Maxwell NPC") after the train crash.
