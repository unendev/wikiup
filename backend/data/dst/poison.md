–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

**Poison** is a new mechanic found in the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC. If a player [Character](/wiki/Character "Character") is hit by a [Mob](/wiki/Mob "Mob") or an environmental hazard that has a naturally poisonous attack they will become poisoned. When a character is poisoned, they will slowly lose [health](/wiki/Health "Health") and [sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"). The poison will theoretically wear off after 3 game days, but multiple users have experienced it lasting 5-6 game days. The effects of poison can be cured by consuming an [Anti Venom](/wiki/Anti_Venom "Anti Venom"). Poison can also be cured by using a [Venom Gland](/wiki/Venom_Gland "Venom Gland"), however, the gland will deal up to 75 poison damage when used, but it will not kill the player character. If the player character has less than 80 health, the damage of the gland is reduced to leave 5 health after consumption.

The effect of poisoning will progressively worsen over time. Initially, poison will deal 1 damage every 10 seconds for the duration of a day. Over the next 2 days, poison will deal increasing amounts of damage, and more frequently. As the damage increases, the poison effect in the UI will become more pronounced. The sanity is lost at a rate of 6 per minute, and will not increase over time. While poisoned, player characters will gain a -0.2 [hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") drain modifier, meaning characters with default hunger drain will get hungry 20% *slower*. Following table describes the increase of the poison effect over time:

| Time since poisoning | Poison Damage | Damage interval |
| --- | --- | --- |
| < 1 day | 1 | 10 seconds |
| < 1.75 days | 1.5 | 10 seconds |
| < 2.25 days | 2 | 10 seconds |
| < 2.7 days | 2.5 | 9 seconds |
| < 2.9 days | 3 | 7 seconds |
| >= 2.9 days | 4 | 5 seconds |

When fighting poisonous enemies, wearing a [Seashell Suit](/wiki/Seashell_Suit "Seashell Suit") or a [Horned Helmet](/wiki/Horned_Helmet "Horned Helmet") will prevent poisoning through physical contact, and wearing a [Particulate Purifier](/wiki/Particulate_Purifier "Particulate Purifier") will prevent poisoning through gas attacks. [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") is immune to poison, therefore they do not require additional protection.

Poison can also affect [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs"), which reduces their damage and movement speed by 25%, and increases their attack period by 25% (in other words, they attack 20% less frequently). Some Mobs are naturally immune to poison. It should be taken into account that upon a poisoned creature dying, all [food](/wiki/Food "Food") items will instead be dropped at half freshness making them stale on drop. Poison lasts 120 seconds for Mobs, after which the poison will wear off.

## Hamlet icon Hamlet[]

The *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC also includes this mechanic. There are two new ways to get poisoned: Eating poisonous Food such as a [Tuber](/wiki/Tuber "Tuber") and being attacked by a [Scorpion](/wiki/Scorpion "Scorpion") with its sting. Besides, there are also three new ways to cure poison: Giving treasures to the [Wishing Well](/wiki/Wishing_Well "Wishing Well"), eating [Magic Water](/wiki/Magic_Water "Magic Water") and using [Poison Balm](/wiki/Poison_Balm "Poison Balm") which is exclusive to [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood").

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Out of the six poisonous creatures, only the poisonous [Spider Warrior](/wiki/Spider_Warrior "Spider Warrior") and [Scorpion](/wiki/Scorpion "Scorpion") can be inflicted with Poison.
* Prior to the *[Hang Ten](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked#December_17th,_2015_-_Hang_Ten_Update "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* update, food drops from poisoned mobs lost all their freshness instantly, making them [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot").
* Before the *[Seas the Day](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked#March_23rd,_2016_-_Seas_the_day_Update "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* update, characters would remain poisoned indefinitely until an Anti Venom was applied.
* Regardless of being immune to poison damage, [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78_quotes "WX-78 quotes") still gets a visual effect from being poisoned.
* The total poison damage is 289.54 over 3 days, which can kill any Character (except [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang")) without healing.

## Mosquito Bugs[]

* Eating [Poison Dartfrog Legs](/wiki/Poison_Dartfrog_Legs "Poison Dartfrog Legs") or Tubers while wearing [Seashell Suit](/wiki/Seashell_Suit "Seashell Suit") or Horned Helmet won't poison the player.
