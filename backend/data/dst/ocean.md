In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* and *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")*, the Ocean is an important area with multiple distinct biomes. Survivors on the ocean without a boat (such as after their boat sinks) will sink in a second or two and find themselves washed up on the nearest shore, briefly unconscious, soaking wet, and missing some possessions. A notable exception is [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie")'s weregoose form, which can run over water.

In *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* and *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")*, the ocean (or cloud ocean) is just an attractive way to mark the edge of the surface world, much like the void in the [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves").

## Don't Starve Together Don't Starve Together[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, the Ocean became accessible via [Boats](/wiki/Boat_Kit "Boat Kit") starting with the *[Turn of Tides](/wiki/Return_of_Them#Turn_of_Tides "Return of Them")* update in *[Return of Them](/wiki/Return_of_Them "Return of Them")*.

The Ocean covers at least as much area as the land and contains several distinct biomes, islands, and bosses, plus a variety of mobs and items:

* Biomes: Coastal, Swell, Rough, Hazardous, Brine Shoals, and [Waterlogged](/wiki/Waterlogged "Waterlogged")
* Islands: [Lunar Island](/wiki/Lunar_Island "Lunar Island") (and [Lunar Archipelago](/wiki/Lunar_Archipelago "Lunar Archipelago")), [Hermit Island](/wiki/Hermit_Island "Hermit Island"), [Moon Quay](/wiki/Moon_Quay "Moon Quay"), and the [Ice Floe](/wiki/Ice_Floe "Ice Floe")
* Bosses: [Crab King](/wiki/Crab_King "Crab King"), [Malbatross](/wiki/Malbatross "Malbatross"), and [Frostjaw](/wiki/Frostjaw "Frostjaw")

[Puffins](/wiki/Puffin "Puffin") will appear on the Ocean instead of the other [Birds](/wiki/Birds "Birds"). [Hounds](/wiki/Hound "Hound") can swim, making Hound attack possible on the Sea. Some [Ocean Debris](/wiki/Ocean_Debris "Ocean Debris"), [Driftwood Pieces](/wiki/Driftwood_Piece "Driftwood Piece"), [Boat Fragments](/wiki/Boat_Fragment "Boat Fragment"), [Cut Grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass") and [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs") will regularly appear close to the player in the Ocean, making [Driftwood Pieces](/wiki/Driftwood_Piece "Driftwood Piece") and [Boat Fragments](/wiki/Boat_Fragment "Boat Fragment") renewable, they sink after few days.

The brightness of the sea corresponds with the time it takes for an [Anchor](/wiki/Anchor_Kit "Anchor Kit") to raise and drop. The darker the ocean, the longer it takes for the anchor to drop/raise.

Some items, instead of sinking, will stay afloat. Non-irreplaceable items that sink in the ocean cannot be retrieved, while irreplaceable items that sink will return to the coast afterwards [Verification Needed].

| Sea StackBoat FragmentPuffinDandy Lionfish |

This is a small ocean [Set Piece](/wiki/Set_Piece "Set Piece"), roughly 7-20 tiles wide that spawns with several [Boat Fragments](/wiki/Boat_Fragment "Boat Fragment"). [Boat Fragments](/wiki/Boat_Fragment "Boat Fragment") spawn randomly on the ocean whenever a player is nearby, but the fragments that define the Hazardous Ocean spawn only once at world creation time. It counts as a biome because [Dandy Lionfish](/wiki/Dandy_Lionfish "Dandy Lionfish") spawn here twice as often as in the Rough Ocean and no other fish are found here. *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* players might be reminded of the [Ship Graveyard](#Ship_Graveyard), but without the Pirate [Ghost](/wiki/Ghost "Ghost").

* Found in the *Rough Ocean*.
* The map shows a barely perceptible oval or round darker-blue patch
* In 1st person, it looks identical to the Rough Ocean, but with a darker, more reddish tinge.
* Take 5 seconds to fully drop/raise the [Anchor Kit](/wiki/Anchor_Kit "Anchor Kit").

**Waterlogged** is a Biome with 3 [giant trees](/wiki/Great_Tree_Trunk "Great Tree Trunk") and several unique creatures. See [Waterlogged](/wiki/Waterlogged "Waterlogged") for details.

## Shipwrecked Shipwrecked[]

In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC, the Ocean plays a much larger role in the player's everyday life. It is accessible by boat or raft, and is commonly divided into several sections: Shallow Ocean, Medium Ocean, Deep Ocean, Ship Graveyard and [Coral Reef](/wiki/Coral_Reef#Biome "Coral Reef"). Flotsam and Pengulls do not spawn in the *Shipwrecked* Ocean.

Some items, instead of sinking, will stay afloat. Unless the item sunk in Deep Ocean, the sunken item will periodically create bubbles, indicating its location. Within 2 days from the time the item sunk, it can be retrieved by sailing over it while using a [Trawl Net](/wiki/Trawl_Net "Trawl Net"). If the item is not retrieved during this time, it will be lost forever. Items that sink in the Deep Ocean tiles are immediately lost and cannot be retrieved.

### Volcano[]

---

## Volcano Cloud Sea

Ocean

In the [Volcano Biome](/wiki/Volcano_Biome "Volcano Biome"), the Ocean that surrounds the Shipwrecked world is replaced by a sea of clouds.

Items dropped at the edge of the Volcano may fall through below the cloud layer and become inaccessible. [Strong Winds](/wiki/Strong_Winds "Strong Winds") can also push dropped items off the edge. Therefore, it is not recommand to leave important items such as [Obsidian](/wiki/Obsidian "Obsidian") on the ground during [Hurricane Season](/wiki/Seasons/Hurricane "Seasons/Hurricane").

**“**I REALLY DO NOT WANT TO FALL INTO THE GLORIFIED SALT PUDDLE**”**

–[WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78")

In the original *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* and *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* content, the **Ocean** acts as a barrier, and during [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), a place for [Pengulls](/wiki/Pengull "Pengull") to spawn before they hop onto shore. No living thing can cross the ocean, not even flying [mobs](/wiki/Mob "Mob") like [Batilisks](/wiki/Batilisk "Batilisk") and [Bees](/wiki/Bee "Bee"). [Flotsams](/wiki/Flotsam "Flotsam") can be found in the ocean, and it is the only object the player can interact with in the ocean.

Objects that are situated on the coast very close to the ocean may drop their items in the ocean, and aside from bugged objects, they will fall into the water with a splash.

## Hamlet Hamlet[]

## Cloud Sea

Ocean

In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")* DLC, the Ocean that surrounds the world is replaced by a sea of clouds. It separates the Hamlet map into five distinct islands.

Items dropped at the edge of the island may fall through below the cloud layer and become inaccessible. [Strong Winds](/wiki/Strong_Winds "Strong Winds") can also push dropped items off the edge.

## Trivia[]

* The *[Strange New Powers](/wiki/Version_History#July_2.2C_2013_-_Strange_New_Powers "Version History")* update added Pengulls which initially spawn in the ocean, before moving onto the shore in Winter.
* [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures") are able to cross into and out of the ocean as they please, but will stay until running toward a player on land should they be aggressive towards them.
* Players using console commands can get over the ocean, but going too far will cause the screen to turn black while only showing the selected character, HUD, Crafting Tabs, Day-Night Indicator, and Inventory. Going further will cause the game to crash.
* In the *Shipwrecked* DLC, the following [Items](/wiki/Items "Items") will float on the Ocean:
  + All [Craftable Items](/wiki/Category:Craftable_Items "Category:Craftable Items"), excluding [Bee Mines](/wiki/Bee_Mine "Bee Mine"), [Cut Stone](/wiki/Cut_Stone "Cut Stone"), [Hibearnation Vests](/wiki/Hibearnation_Vest "Hibearnation Vest"), [Houndius Shootius](/wiki/Houndius_Shootius "Houndius Shootius"), [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice"), [Insulated Packs](/wiki/Insulated_Pack "Insulated Pack"), [One-man Bands](/wiki/One-man_Band "One-man Band"), [Pumpkin Lanterns](/wiki/Pumpkin_Lantern "Pumpkin Lantern"), [Rain Coats](/wiki/Rain_Coat "Rain Coat"), [Sandbags](/wiki/Sandbag "Sandbag"), [Scalemail](/wiki/Scalemail "Scalemail"), [Tar Lamps](/wiki/Tar_Lamp "Tar Lamp"), [Thulecite](/wiki/Thulecite "Thulecite"), [Thulecite Clubs](/wiki/Thulecite_Club "Thulecite Club"), [Thulecite Medallions](/wiki/Thulecite_Medallion "Thulecite Medallion"), [Tooth Traps](/wiki/Tooth_Trap "Tooth Trap"), [Torches](/wiki/Torch "Torch"), all kinds of [Saddles](/wiki/Saddle "Saddle"), [Brushes](/wiki/Brush "Brush"), [Feather Pencils](/wiki/Feather_Pencil "Feather Pencil"), [Mini Signs](/wiki/Mini_Sign "Mini Sign"), [Wood Fences](/wiki/Wood_Fence "Wood Fence"), [Wood Gates](/wiki/Wood_Gate "Wood Gate")
