The **Compendium** is an [Interface](/wiki/Category:Interface "Category:Interface") feature exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. It allows the player to view various types of information about different aspects of the game.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Much of the information contained in the Compendium was once kept in the Item Collection menu. This was changed upon the Compendium's inclusion as part of the [May QOL update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History#May_28,_2020_-_May_QOL_Update "Don't Starve Together/Version History").
* Many characters' birthdays correspond with a game update that character is involved with.
* The Plant Registry was introduced in the *[Reap What You Sow](/wiki/Reap_What_You_Sow "Reap What You Sow")* update.
