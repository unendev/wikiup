**Webber** is one of the two playable [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") exclusive to the [*Reign of Giants*](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants") DLC. He's the only one of the two that is not unlocked via [Experience](/wiki/Experience "Experience"). He's also one of the playable Characters in [*Don't Starve Together*](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together"). Webber looks like a humanoid spider, though he's actually a child that was fused with a spider that tried to eat him. He received a character refresh exclusive to DST in June 2021.[[1]](#cite_note-1)

## Minimap Maxwell's Door Origin[]

**“**Listen well children, and mind the warnings of your parents... naughtiness always comes back to bite you in the end. **”**

–Official description of the *[Along Came A Spider](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Along_Came_A_Spider "Animated Shorts and Trailers")* animated short

 File:Don%27t Starve Together- Along Came A Spider -Webber Animated Short- 

Don't Starve Together- Along Came A Spider -Webber Animated Short-

 

Webber's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled *[Along Came A Spider](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Along_Came_A_Spider "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*. An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium"):

*Once upon a time, there was a young boy who lived with his family on a small farmstead. Though they lived humbly, the boy's home was filled with love, and he grew up happy and kind. The boy might have lived contentedly for the rest of his days if not for the sudden arrival of an old aquaintance[sic], who came to the house beseeching the boy's father for his expertise on a strange and secretive project...*

## Lock Unlocking[]

Webber, escaping into his grave.

 

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Webber's Skull](/wiki/Webber%27s_Skull "Webber's Skull")*

To unlock Webber one must be playing in a *Reign of Giants* save game. The player has to find Webber's Skull as a drop from Spiders, then bury the skull inside a dug up [Grave](/wiki/Grave "Grave") mound. After that, [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") will immediately strike the grave. Webber will rise from the mound and become unlocked. Following this, numerous Spiders will proceed to spawn from the grave, but killing them is not required to unlock Webber.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

### In-Game[]

* Webber was added to *Don't Starve: Reign of Giants* in the *[Giant Steps](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants#April_2.2C_2014_-_Giant_Steps_Steam_Beta_Update "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* update on April 2, 2014.
* In response to a fan comparing Webber's voice to the sound of someone dropping a synthesizer down a flight of stairs, sound designer Matt replied "I won't say I did drop a synth down the stairs... but I won't say I didn't..."[[2]](#cite_note-2)
* He is one of six characters that cannot be unlocked via experience, alongside [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes"), [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(character) "Maxwell (character)"), [Wilbur](/wiki/Wilbur "Wilbur"), [Woodlegs](/wiki/Woodlegs "Woodlegs"), and [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba").
* The examination lines used for Webber right after unlocking him and before he disappears are the same lines used for characters on the [Nightmare Throne](/wiki/Nightmare_Throne "Nightmare Throne"). For example, [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") will say "He's trapped!"
* Webber is the only character whose [skull](/wiki/Webber%27s_Skull "Webber's Skull") is used in game.
* On one of Klei's streams, [Frog Webber](/wiki/Unimplemented_Characters#Frog_Webber "Unimplemented Characters"), a character with Webber's ability as well as unique ones of his own, as shown. He was able to jump with a cane and may have been neutral to [Frogs](/wiki/Frog "Frog") like Webber is to spiders. His Health, Hunger, and Sanity were the same as those of Webber. Klei later released him as a [mod character](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=451023177) for Don't Starve Together.
* In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* Webber is featured in the [Cult of the Lamb Crossover](/wiki/Cult_of_the_Lamb_Crossover "Cult of the Lamb Crossover"), appearing in the *Cult of the Lamb* side as a guest character (see ["Webber" on Cult of the Lamb Wiki](https://cult-of-the-lamb.fandom.com/wiki/Webber)).

### Lore[]

* It's possible that Webber came into the [Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant") before Wilson, and died in the world.
* His quote when examining [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(NPC) "Maxwell (NPC)") ("That jerk tricked us.") and his quote for the [Maxwell Statue](/wiki/Maxwell_Statue "Maxwell Statue") ("That's the guy who said he could help us."), suggests that he has been fooled into entering the Constant by being promised something which he immensely desires by Maxwell. This is similar to the backstory of Wilson where Maxwell tricks him with what he desires, which may also be the case for other characters. It is likely that Maxwell promised Webber a cure for his condition.
* Webber refers to himself with both singular (I, Me, My) and plural (We, Us, Our) pronouns, suggesting a two-minds-one-body relation. It's likely that he is referring to the Spider that fused with him when not referring to himself directly.
* According to his inspection comment for a [Redbird](/wiki/Redbird "Redbird"), Webber's favorite color is red. However, when examining a [Blue Spore](/wiki/Blue_Spore "Blue Spore"), he will say it is blue. The writer for *Don't Starve: Together* stated on *Rhymes With Play* #228 that this is meant to show that Webber likes all colors.
* According to Webber's Guest of Honor [skin](/wiki/Skins "Skins") description and quote in *Don't Starve: Together*, he loves formal parties, unlike Wilson.
* According to his examination quote for [Charcoal](/wiki/Charcoal "Charcoal"), Webber believes that his spider side is better.
* Webber's [loading screen vignette](/wiki/Vignettes "Vignettes") is accompanied by text that reveals how he feels about his current situation: *Webber could have easily seen his unique predicament as an affliction or a curse. Instead, he's chosen to view it as a second chance, and one that he fully intends not to waste.*
* Webber's quotes reveal the existence of some of [his family members](/wiki/Minor_Characters "Minor Characters") as well as some insight into his home life prior to being eaten by a spider and entering the Constant. His mentioned family members include his father, mother, and grandfather.
  + According to Webber's quote about the [Alchemy Engine](/wiki/Alchemy_Engine "Alchemy Engine"), Webber's dad might have been a scientist.[[3]](#cite_note-3) On the other hand, he also states that his father kept goats[[4]](#cite_note-4) and taught Webber how to raise them,[[5]](#cite_note-5). Webber also mentions that his father wore Top Hats and had a beard.[[6]](#cite_note-6) [[7]](#cite_note-7)
  + Webber's mother seemed to be typically mindful, warning Webber of the dangers of the kitchen[[8]](#cite_note-8) and to always eat his vegetables. She took Webber antique shopping with her,[[9]](#cite_note-9) and he remembers how she would make turkey dinner.[[10]](#cite_note-10)
  + Webber's grandfather taught him chess, made meatballs with him, and took him on fishing trips.[[11]](#cite_note-11) [[12]](#cite_note-12) [[13]](#cite_note-13) He also had a cat named Whiskers.[[14]](#cite_note-14) Webber says that the [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter") reminds him of his grandfather,[[15]](#cite_note-15) which may mean that he is a Scottish descendant, or at least British. He also mentions that the [Floral Shirt](/wiki/Floral_Shirt "Floral Shirt") was "his Grandfather's style"[[16]](#cite_note-16) and that the [Kingly Figure](/wiki/Chess_Pieces#Kingly_Figure "Chess Pieces") "Reminds [him] of grandpa."[[17]](#cite_note-17)
  + His grandmother made preserves.[[18]](#cite_note-18)
  + Along with the above quotes about goat-keeping, Webber's family seems to have owned a farm,[[19]](#cite_note-19) where they may have grown crops[[20]](#cite_note-20) and owned a mill.[[21]](#cite_note-21)
* According to his quote for the [Battle Helm](/wiki/Battle_Helm "Battle Helm") ("Haha! It's way too big for us!"), Webber is smaller in stature than [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") at the very least.
* When Webber dies, he will drop two [Souls](/wiki/Soul "Soul") if [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox") is nearby. This is also corroborated by Wortox's examination quote for Webber's Skull: "Hm. There's two souls wedged inside."
* Webber's Birthday is listed as April 30 in the [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium"). April 30, 2014 was the original release date for *Reign of Giants*.
* The description of Webber's Farmspider skin reads: "Webber's memories of his old appearance have gotten a little fuzzy over time."
* Webber is hinted to be close friends with Wendy through their dialogue and joint appearances in animated shorts.

### Cultural References[]

* For his Victorian skin, Webber wears a [sailor suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_suit#As_children.27s_clothing "wikipedia:Sailor suit"), a popular type of children's clothing during the Victorian era.
* His El Tigre Cub skin may be a reference to [Tiger Mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Mask_(professional_wrestling) "wikipedia:Tiger Mask (professional wrestling)"), a professional wrestling persona.
