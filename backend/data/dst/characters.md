Character select in *Don't Starve Together*.

 

There is currently a combined total of **twenty-five** playable **Characters** in *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")*, its [DLCs](/wiki/DLC "DLC"), and *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* (DST). Each Character has at least one character-specific perk, in addition to various bonuses and penalties to their stats, and usually are different in play style. Each Character is "voiced" by a different instrument, and [speaks](/wiki/Character_quotes "Character quotes") differently when examining items and objects. The only exception to this is [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes"), the speechless mime, who uses [pantomimes](/wiki/Wes_quotes "Wes quotes") instead of sounds or quotes.

## Don't Starve Don't Starve[]

The first accessible Characters are [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") and [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff"), considered the protagonists and the focus of the game's story. Most of the other Characters can be unlocked when sufficient [Experience](/wiki/Experience "Experience") has been accrued, gained at [Death](/wiki/Death "Death") or when [escaping](/wiki/Teleportato "Teleportato") to a new world. There are currently six Characters that are not unlocked via experience, but through game feats. If the player has not unlocked a Character, they will appear as their respective silhouette. Upon selecting a silhouette, the Poster on the left will be a coffin shut with chains and a lock, and the description will simply say "The Unknown".

## Don't Starve Together Don't Starve Together[]

*Don't Starve Together* includes all Characters from the base game and *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* DLC, but excluding [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff"), [Walani](/wiki/Walani "Walani"), [Wilbur](/wiki/Wilbur "Wilbur"), [Woodlegs](/wiki/Woodlegs "Woodlegs"), [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba"), and [Wheeler](/wiki/Wheeler "Wheeler"). All character abilities have been [redesigned](/wiki/Character_Refresh "Character Refresh") to accommodate multiplayer and provide a more unique gameplay experience. And unlocked from the start.
The first DST exclusive character was [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona") who was added as a free update on September 13, 2017.[[1]](#cite_note-1)[[2]](#cite_note-2)

Maxwell initially serves as the main antagonist of *Don't Starve*. He appears before the start of every game, saying, *"Say pal, you don't look so good. You better find something to eat before night comes!"* He disappears before the player assumes control of their character.

As seen in *[Forbidden Knowledge](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Forbidden_Knowledge "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*, Maxwell gives Wilson the knowledge necessary to build [Maxwell's Door](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door") which captures Wilson and takes him into [The Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant").

When the player chooses to play as Maxwell, non-playable Maxwell will not appear. Maxwell will instead awaken and exclaim *"Freedom, at last!"*

However, the developers left his code in the game, allowing players to use him via console commands. In-game, his portrait is between [Woodlegs](/wiki/Woodlegs "Woodlegs") and [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba").

## Minor Characters[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 See also: [Minor Characters](/wiki/Minor_Characters "Minor Characters")*

Once downloaded, the character can be set up in its directory. When the player starts up the game, they can click the Mods button to enable the character. They will now be available for use after restarting.

## Trivia[]

* All playable characters' names start with W apart from Maxwell's. Within the game's code, Maxwell's name is written "Waxwell," in line with the other characters and not to confuse playable Maxwell with NPC Maxwell. The [trailer puzzles](/wiki/William_Carter_Puzzles "William Carter Puzzles") confirmed that Maxwell's real name is William Carter.
  + Having all characters' names start with W was unintentional at first, but [Klei](/wiki/Klei "Klei") decided to go with it. [Verification Needed]
* Wolfgang was previously unlocked after Wendy.
* All characters are ambidextrous thanks to their [sprite work](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbidextrousSprite).
* For the characters' voices being played by instruments, the developers were inspired by both the teacher's voice in the *Peanuts* specials and the musical composition *[Peter and the Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_the_Wolf "wikipedia:Peter and the Wolf")*.[[3]](#cite_note-3)
* Before the *Shipwrecked* characters were released, they each had a locked character portrait, the title of "The Unfinished", the motto quote of "*Don't look at me. I'm not ready yet.*", and the perk of "Hasn't arrived on the island yet".
* Upon his release, Wortox's speech file contained examination quotes for a character labeled `"NEXTCHARACTER"`.[[4]](#cite_note-4) These quotes were removed at some time between Warly's update and Woodie's refresh.
  + Generic- "Hyuyu, what are you up to %s?"
  + Attacker- "Don't get my goat, little %s!"
  + Murderer- "Eep! Don't slaughter me!"
  + Reviver- "Thank-you, thank-you, little goat!"
  + Ghost- "Don't worry, I'm not hungry."
  + Firestarter- "Little goat! You played pranks without me!"
* When idling, all characters perform the same random animations, such as scratching themselves and kicking the ground. Exclusively in *Don't Starve Together*, each character is given a unique idle animation starting with Wormwood's debut. The animations are as follows:
  + Wormwood mimics butterfly wings with his hand leaves, as he does in *[Lunar Roots](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Lunar_Roots "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*.
  + Wortox dances happily. His animation was added in the [June 10, 2019](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History#June_10,_2019 "Don't Starve Together/Version History") update.
  + Warly sniffs a waft of air. This was added in his [debut update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History#July_25,_2019_-_Warly_Character_Update "Don't Starve Together/Version History").
  + Winona stretches her shoulder. This was also added in Warly's update.
  + When holding Bernie, Willow hugs him. This is the third idle animation added in Warly's update.
  + When holding Lucy, Woodie caresses her. This was added in [Woodie's refresh update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History#September_12,_2019_-_Woodie_Character_Update "Don't Starve Together/Version History").
  + Wurt scratches her horn.
  + Wendy plucks petals from a flower. This was added in [Wendy's refresh update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History#March_19,_2020_-_Wendy_Character_Update "Don't Starve Together/Version History").
  + Walter salutes.
  + Wigfrid takes a bow. This was added in [Wigfrid's refresh update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History#September_24,_2020_-_Wigfrid_Character_Update "Don't Starve Together/Version History").
  + Wes blows up a red [Balloon](/wiki/Pile_o%27_Balloons#Balloon "Pile o' Balloons") which pops in his face. This was added in [Wes' refresh update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History#April_1,_2021_-_Wes_Character_Update "Don't Starve Together/Version History").
  + Webber makes a small web with a heart shape hole in his hands.
  + Wanda impatiently checks a watch.
  + Wolfgang flexes and poses.
  + WX-78's arm falls off, then they reattach it.
  + Wonkey looks at their tail.
  + Wickerbottom does a shushing gesture
  + Maxwell adjusts his sleeves with a small chance of a card falling out and him hiding it with his foot.
  + Wilson looks up thoughtfully, and strokes his beard if it is at or past the second stage of growth.
