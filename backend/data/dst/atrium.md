**“**Why would anyone want to live down here?**”**

–[Willow](/wiki/Willow "Willow")

The **Atrium** is a [Biome](/wiki/Biome "Biome") exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, introduced in *[A New Reign](/wiki/A_New_Reign "A New Reign")*. Its composition is similar to the [Labyrinth](/wiki/Labyrinth "Labyrinth") biome, with some variances. It is isolated from the rest of the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins"), being only accessible by hopping into a [Tentacle Pillar Hole](/wiki/Tentacle#Big_Tentacle "Tentacle") after killing a Big Tentacle or using a [Lazy Explorer](/wiki/Lazy_Explorer "Lazy Explorer"). The [Ancient Gateway](/wiki/Ancient_Gateway "Ancient Gateway") is located at the end of the Atrium.

Once the player makes it to the Atrium Biome they must pass the [Obelisks](/wiki/Obelisk "Obelisk") which will be in a closed state unless the player has less than 15% Sanity. Players must be careful to never go above 15% Sanity otherwise they will be trapped on the island.

The path to the Ancient Gateway looks like a zig-zag, with many [Ancient Fences](/wiki/Ancient_Fence "Ancient Fence") blocking the path. The area is also filled with [Dangling Depth Dwellers](/wiki/Dangling_Depth_Dweller "Dangling Depth Dweller"), [Ancient Obelisks](/wiki/Ancient_Obelisk "Ancient Obelisk"), Obelisks, [Ancient Beacons](/wiki/Ancient_Beacon "Ancient Beacon"), [Atrium Statues](/wiki/Ancient_Statue#Atrium_Statue "Ancient Statue") and [Ornate Chests](/wiki/Ornate_Chest "Ornate Chest"), much like the Labyrinth.

At the end of the Biome, there is a large area with the Ancient Gateway in the middle and in the borders, [Ancient Murals](/wiki/Ancient_Mural "Ancient Mural"), Beacons, [Pillars](/wiki/Pillars "Pillars") and Atrium Statues.

Like the Ruins, the Atrium has the [Nightmare Cycle](/wiki/Nightmare_Cycle "Nightmare Cycle"). Upon inserting an [Ancient Key](/wiki/Ancient_Key "Ancient Key") in the Gateway, the Cycle will be locked at its peak state, and will not leave said state unless the key is removed from the Gateway.

After the [Ancient Fuelweaver](/wiki/Ancient_Fuelweaver "Ancient Fuelweaver") is defeated in the Gateway room, it will start shaking continuously for 3 minutes, after which the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") will reset.

## Tips[]

* Bringing [The Lazy Explorer](/wiki/The_Lazy_Explorer "The Lazy Explorer") and/or a [Nightmare Amulet](/wiki/Nightmare_Amulet "Nightmare Amulet") is ideal over manually decreasing and increasing one's sanity in order to pass the Obelisks, since one can easily get stuck or be killed by the [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures") if their Sanity drops below 15%.
* It is a good idea to bring something to instantly restore Sanity so that one does not get stuck behind the Obelisks, such as [Cooked Green Caps](/wiki/Cap/Green "Cap/Green") or [Ice Cream](/wiki/Ice_Cream "Ice Cream").

## Trivia[]

* An atrium is a hall or court at either the entrance or center of a building, and also refers to two of the chambers of the heart (organ).
