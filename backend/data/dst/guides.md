## Petals Nature of guides[]

Guides are usually **subjective** and **instructional** as they are highly based on personal in-game experience. In addition, **the [Manual of Style](/wiki/Manual_of_Style "Manual of Style") is not applicable** to any guide pages. For example, first person can be used and formatting is less strict than normal articles. All of the guide pages should follow the rules on this page instead.

Guides can also be **inaccurate**, as the bias from guide writers are included during the draft. Therefore, users are not recommended to follow all the instructions in guides blindly. Instead, please **play according to your play style** and your objectives in-game. It feels much better and more rewarding if you found your own ways of success, and to share them with us.

**Guides are merely opinions and hold no responsibilities to your decision and consequences**. You should be responsible for your [Character](/wiki/Character "Character") and think carefully in order to survive longer in *Don't Starve*. If there are any factual errors in the guide, please help correct them immediately so that fellow users will not be misled and suffer a loss.

**Guides are open to edit by everyone**. If you want to create a private guide, please create a [blog](/wiki/Special:CreateBlogPage "Special:CreateBlogPage"). Remember to add the appropriate templates and category (more details in the below section), so that everyone can identify your guide easily. However, all Administrators and [Custodians](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Wiki:Custodians "Don't Starve Wiki:Custodians") have the right to edit your guides in order to maintain the standards of the wiki, where situations include:

* Missing templates/categories
* Serious factual errors
* Typos/wrong links
* Violations of [Wikia Terms of Use](https://community.fandom.com/wiki/Terms_of_Use "w:Terms of Use")/[Local rules](/wiki/Rules "Rules")
* For the sake of improving the quality of your guide

## Blueprint When creating your guide[]

* You may want to credit the major contributors of the guide, especially when you are referring to or borrowing another players' ideas.

* When creating a guide, the **page name** should follow the syntax below:

```
Guides/<guidename>
```

or

```
User blog:Wikia/Guides/<guidename>
```

* Please add {{[Instructional](/wiki/Template:Instructional "Template:Instructional")}} to the **top** of the guide, if it contains highly subjective/instructional language.

```
{{Instructional}}
```

* Please add {{[Guide](/wiki/Template:Guide "Template:Guide")}} at the **end** of the guide; this will categorize the guide automatically under [Category:Guides](/wiki/Category:Guides "Category:Guides").

```
{{Guide}}
```
