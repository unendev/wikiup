**Don't Starve Celebrates 10 Years!**

Can you believe it? 10 years of Wilson, the Survivors and the Constant. From our humble beginnings as a Chrome app to well over 25 million copies all around the world and we haven't slowed down yet. Countless updates, bug reports, hot fixes, puzzles, fan art, and even some songs (Beefaloooo!). Don't Starve wouldn't be what it is today without our fans. We've watched some of you grow up and we've watched ourselves grow up.

We're not perfect, but we truly do try our hardest to do the best we can for you all and we hope you feel the same love from us that we feel from you.

**Thank you. From all of us.**

To celebrate we have a few gifts for you. This post is going to get rather large, so hang in there with me please.

We got together and signed a poster for you!

Unfortunately we couldn't print and send out a poster to all 25+ million of you, but we did make a high rez poster that you can print yourself. Both a signed and unsigned original Thank You poster made for DS10 is available on the Klei Rewards page for free. We've also added another special signed and unsigned version as vignettes in Don't Starve Together.

**Free Anniversary Login Bonus in Don't Starve Together.**

The Celebratory Science Machine and Celebratory Cake Chest are available for free for a limited time just for logging into the game. We'll add these to Klei Rewards at some point in the future, but if you want them now, go get 'em!

We also have some new skins for sale in the game. **The Complete Verdant Chest** and the **Blooming Verdant Chest** are now available.

**All the Streams!**

It would be absolutely insane if we didn't take a moment to thank our streamers. And to do that we have given our Ambassadors 10 bundle codes of item skins and a bonus code for 10k spools for Ambassadors to give to their viewers. So go head over to an Ambassador stream, check them out for your chance for one of over 3000 codes up for grabs.

**Our own Stream!**

We're also going to be hosting our own stream later today where we'll be taking about "Taking Root" and revealing some info about what's coming up in the next update and what the heck is going on in "From Beyond"

Be sure to click the follow button on the Klei Twitch channel to get alerted whenever we go live

Feel free to use our handy widget below to see when the Dev Cast goes live in your area:

**New Twitch Drops!**

We're offering a new set of streaming drops over on Twitch.tv. *(expired)*

**I think that's it!**

It's probably also worth mentioning that all but the newest skins are on sale right now and Don't Starve Together is currently on massive discount on all platforms. (Up to 90% off!)

We're already well on our way into the next couple updates. And we'll have more information about that soon enough. But for now, that's it for this post. As always, here's a nice link for some spools, just for being you. If you have any friends or family that pick up the game during the big sale, make sure to let them know because you can get a lot of great stuff with the 10k Klei Points in that link!

Till next time friends, Thank you. And have fun out there!
