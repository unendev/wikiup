## Advantages[]

Wendy's special power is her ability to summon her dead twin sister, [Abigail](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail"). Wendy starts with a wilted [Abigail's Flower](/wiki/Abigail%27s_Flower "Abigail's Flower") in her inventory, which blooms in roughly 2-4 full Days, at which point she will be able to summon Abigail.

When Abigail's Flower has bloomed, it can be placed on the ground to prepare the summoning. The summoning requires the death of a [Mob](/wiki/Mob "Mob") near the Flower. This includes Wendy herself but excludes any captured Mobs "murdered" through the inventory (single player only). Summoning Abigail will cost 50 Sanity to Wendy.

Wendy, Abigail, and Chester by the fire.

 

Abigail follows Wendy and will attack Mobs that either attack Wendy or that Wendy herself attacks. Abigail cannot hurt Wendy, and normally doesn't attack any allies, such as [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester"), unless Wendy herself attacks them first. Abigail will always move away from Wendy when she comes too close. Abigail's attack damages all mobs in range at the same time, which makes Wendy exceptionally strong against groups of mobs like [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders") and [Bees](/wiki/Bees "Bees") as Abigail can keep stunning them to keep them from attacking back.

Abigail's Flower will be dropped on the ground when Abigail is killed. It will be completely wilted and it will have to bloom before it can be used again.

Another special power Wendy has is that she suffers 25% less Sanity drain from Darkness and from being near insanity auras. The effect only extends to those two cases though, meaning that other things that drain Sanity (e.g. [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain"), [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword"), [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") etc.) will drain it at the same rate as other Characters (except [Walani](/wiki/Walani "Walani")).

### Shipwrecked Shipwrecked[]

In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC, Abigail is immune to [Poison](/wiki/Poison "Poison"), making her useful when fighting venomous enemies. She also can float over water making her able to follow Wendy between islands, unlike most other [Followers](/wiki/Followers "Followers").

## Disadvantage[]

Wendy's attacks are 25% weaker than most other Characters' in order to balance out the ability to summon Abigail, and the lowered Sanity drain. For example, Wendy needs two attacks to kill a [Rabbit](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit") with the [Boomerang](/wiki/Boomerang "Boomerang") or a [Tool](/wiki/Category:Tools_Tab "Category:Tools Tab"). As such, hunting certain Mobs can be much more difficult whilst playing Wendy as she deals less damage by herself. Attacking stronger mobs without Abigail is not advised.

## Tips[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Guides/Character guides-Wendy](/wiki/Guides/Character_guides-Wendy "Guides/Character guides-Wendy")*

* Early on the easiest way to summon Abigail is to kill a Butterfly, which will die in 1 hit even when Wendy is unarmed. Alternatively the Flower can be dropped near a [Spider Den](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") that also has a [Pig House](/wiki/Pig_House "Pig House") nearby. Getting the [Pig](/wiki/Pig "Pig")  and [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders") to fight each other will ensure Abigail is summoned from the casualties.
* Abigail won't keep fighting Mobs forever and sometimes needs to be ordered to do so mid-fight. Keep an eye on the battle so to keep her focused on the task.
* Since she can outrun [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbits "Rabbits"), Abigail is a source of easy [Morsels](/wiki/Morsels "Morsels").
  + In Shipwrecked she can also be used to easily kill [Crabbits](/wiki/Crabbits "Crabbits") and [Jellyfishes](/wiki/Jellyfish "Jellyfish").
* Abigail is at her strongest during Winter and Hurricane Season (in SW) since days are shorter and she deals bonus damage as the sky darkens. Leave any unfinished fights against neutral foes ([Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard"), [Spider Queens](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen"), etc.) for this season.
  + Although it is always dark in [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves"), there's a day-night system in place, meaning Abigail will not always do 40 damage per hit. In the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") though it's always considered Night.
* Abigail can tank and damage [Pengulls](/wiki/Pengull "Pengull") rather easily, and can take the full camp with Wendy's help at Dusk without too much risk. This means Wendy has a fairly reliable source of Food in the Winter.
* While Abigail is great against groups of weaker foes, fighting stronger Mobs will result in her death unless she's helped by Wendy. Great support weapons are the [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff") and [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff"). The Ice Staff can be used to stun enemies before they land a hit on Abigail, preventing her from taking damage. The Fire Staff can stun Mobs for longer while also damaging them but comes at the cost of possibly burning the dropped loot upon the enemy's death.
  + In Shipwrecked, Abigail comes as great help during combat as she is immune to [Poison](/wiki/Poison "Poison") and can attack [Aquatic Mobs](/wiki/Category:Aquatic_Mobs "Category:Aquatic Mobs") at a distance, making the low health of [Boats](/wiki/Boats "Boats") less of a problem.
* Despite the Sanity icon not displaying an arrow, the [Top Hat](/wiki/Top_Hat "Top Hat") will not completely keep Sanity from draining in the dark.
* Weapons that deal indirect damage ([Fire Dart](/wiki/Fire_Dart "Fire Dart"), [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder"), etc.) are not affected by Wendy's damage multiplier making them excellent choices for her.
  + A good [melee Weapon](/wiki/Weapons#Melee_weapons "Weapons") for Wendy is the [Ham Bat](/wiki/Ham_Bat "Ham Bat"), since it has unlimited uses while fresh, effectively erasing one of the drawbacks of the reduced damage.
* Due to the way the bonus damage is calculated on the [Obsidian Spear](/wiki/Obsidian_Spear "Obsidian Spear"), [Axe](/wiki/Obsidian_Axe "Obsidian Axe") and [Machete](/wiki/Obsidian_Machete "Obsidian Machete") in SW, they won't do as low damage as they would normally making them still very good when used with Wendy.
* In https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f8/Reign of Giants icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20140408110712, with a [Garland](/wiki/Garland "Garland") and a [Pretty Parasol](/wiki/Pretty_Parasol "Pretty Parasol") equipped, Wendy suffers almost no sanity drain at night, meaning gathering 18 [Petals](/wiki/Petals "Petals") can keep her sanity up during both night and day during the early days when other sanity-restoring alternatives are unavailable.
* Care should be taken when fighting alongside Abigail, as a single hit from Wendy dismisses her. This is particularly important on the console versions of the game, as the automatic targeting can accidentally attack her instead of an enemy.
* Taming an Ornery [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") can be very advantageous for Wendy, taking away her damage reduction and giving her a reliable method of combat when Abigail is unavailable.
* Wendy can order Abigail to attack and kill monsters and innocent creatures that increase [Naughtiness](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus"), such as [Glommer](/wiki/Glommer "Glommer") to get [Old Bells](/wiki/Old_Bell "Old Bell"). This method can be used to prevent Krampus from spawning, if the player does not desire to trigger the spawning of one or more.
  + In Shipwrecked, this can be useful to prevent the spawning of [Floaty Boaty Knights](/wiki/Floaty_Boaty_Knight "Floaty Boaty Knight").

## Bugs[]

* While wearing some of the hats, Wendy's flower and the top of her hair will disappear when the player moves towards the top of the screen, and will appear again when she stops moving.
