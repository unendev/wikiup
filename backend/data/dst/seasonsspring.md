**“**My clothes appear to be permeable.**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

**Spring** is one of the four [seasons](/wiki/Seasons "Seasons") from the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, indicated in appearance by the world having a greenish tint.

It has a 50% chance to be the starting season instead of [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn") when playing in [Survival Mode](/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"). With the Default Preferences, it lasts 20 days. Therefore, the first Spring lasts either from day 1 to 20, or from day 37 to 56. During the beginning and especially the middle of Spring, [Dusks](/wiki/Dusk "Dusk") are very long (affecting player's sanity) but they quickly go shorter towards the last third of the season. Stages in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") may have different seasonal variations. Some characteristics in the world change in Spring, and surviving can become more difficult.

## Changes in the World[]

* During Spring, [Mini Glaciers](/wiki/Mini_Glacier "Mini Glacier") will begin to melt and [Bees](/wiki/Bee "Bee") will become red and more hostile (though they are still not considered [Killer Bees](/wiki/Killer_Bee "Killer Bee")).

* [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo")s will enter mating phase and stay in the mating phase for the full season.

The giant of Spring: Moose/Goose.

 

* Flowers will randomly spawn during spring even when there are no insects around.

* [Rabbit Holes](/wiki/Rabbit_Hole "Rabbit Hole") close during Spring, forcing the player to look for a different food source.

* The [Moose/Goose](/wiki/Moose/Goose "Moose/Goose") and its nest can be encountered during Spring.

* [Lureplants](/wiki/Lureplant "Lureplant") will naturally spawn in areas that the player has explored. Additionally, [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") will always be in heat and [Blue Hounds](/wiki/Hound#Blue_Hound "Hound") can spawn with Hound waves.
* [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") will start to bloom during this season.
* Maximum chase time and range for enemies is increased by 33%.
* Trees take 25% less time to grow to next stage.

## Rain and its effects[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness")*

Spring is the season where [rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") is very frequent and puddles form on the ground that will completely dry out in [Summer](/wiki/Seasons/Summer "Seasons/Summer").

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/6a/Wetness Meter.png/revision/latest?cb=20190617115124 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/6a/Wetness Meter.png/revision/latest?cb=20190617115124 

The Wetness Meter.

 

Constant rain means that [fuel](/wiki/Fire#Fuel_Values "Fire") is less efficient when lighting fires and more of it is needed to maintain a [fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire"). In particular way, [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") players must be more aware of this menace because of the damage taken from water and [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness"). Additionally, [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") strikes are much more frequent in Spring and can cause damage to the player (though representing an advantage for WX-78) or to unprotected structures vulnerable to fire. There is also a chance of [Frog Rain](/wiki/Frog_Rain "Frog Rain")s occurring.

While temperature is not an issue at this time of year, the player will occasionally [freeze](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") due to wetness, especially during the start of the season because of the low temperatures.

Rain from the surface seeps into the soil, causing the [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") and [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") to drip water from their ceiling, having the same effect as rain (this means higher [Sanity Loss](/wiki/Sanity_Loss "Sanity Loss") to account for), albeit the Wetness meter will rise significantly slower. Note that rain in the underground is constant in Spring and will keep going on until the season ends.

Frequent rain makes tracking [Koalefants](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant") and other creatures from [Suspicious Dirt Piles](/wiki/Suspicious_Dirt_Pile "Suspicious Dirt Pile") more difficult due to tracks disappearing.

[Meats](/wiki/Meats "Meats") hung on a [Drying Rack](/wiki/Drying_Rack "Drying Rack") won't dry if it's raining. Other than that, the drying process will become slower due to humidity.

On the positive side, rain causes crops to grow much quicker and [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms") can be picked more frequently as rain causes them to regenerate. [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bushes "Berry Bushes") and other pickable plants also regenerate 33% faster.
