Being the default [Character](/wiki/Character "Character"), Wilson's [Health](/wiki/Health "Health"), [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"), and [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") all have default values and he has no drawbacks. Overall, Wilson is meant for better [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter") survival and efficiency, as well as easier access to [Meat Effigies](/wiki/Meat_Effigies "Meat Effigies").

Wilson's main perk is his magnificent Beard. Depending on its length, the Beard provides up to 135 insulation against [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") and can be shaved, providing [Beard Hair](/wiki/Beard_Hair "Beard Hair") and restoring 10 Sanity. If Wilson dies, the Beard will be reset.

Below is the days it takes Wilson to grow his Beard to the next stage, along with the number of Beard Hair gained and Insulation provided with each stage.

| Days of growth | Length | Beard Hair Yield | Insulation Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 Days | Short Beard | 1 (0.25/day) | 15 seconds |
| 8 Days | Long Beard | 3 (0.43/day) | 45 seconds |
| 16 Days | Magnificent Beard | 9 (0.6/day) | 135 seconds |

## Tips[]

* Wilson's [favorite food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Bacon and Eggs](/wiki/Bacon_and_Eggs "Bacon and Eggs"), meaning he gains 15 bonus Hunger when consuming the food.
* The earliest one can build a Meat Effigy is on day 11. Shave as soon as possible for 1 hair, and shave the Long Beard for the other 3. This is not the most efficient way, but it is the quickest (outside of lowering Sanity to hunt [Beardlings](/wiki/Beardlings "Beardlings"), or fighting [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") to transmute [Beefalo Wool](/wiki/Beefalo_Wool "Beefalo Wool")).
* As the Beard doesn't grow longer after 16 (10 with skill tree) days and the player loses it on resurrection or by changing characters, it is most efficient to shave after every sixteenth (tenth with skill tree) day, unless Winter is coming.
* In terms of gaining Sanity, shaving every 5 days will yield the best results.
* Wilson's Beard will take exactly 15 days to grow to its full length (full length at the beginning of day 16). Since Winter starts on day 21 on default settings, the player can easily survive the cold with just a full Beard and a [Thermal Stone](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone"). The Beard, unlike [clothing](/wiki/Clothes "Clothes"), does not have durability and will provide insulation so long as he does not shave.
  + Wilson can shave the Beard after four days (for one Beard Hair) and still have a full Beard by winter. It is also possible to shave after reaching a **long** Beard length (8 days), as while Wilson will not *start* winter with a full Beard, the first few days are more mild and will allow for time to grow.
  + It is advised to shave at the beginning of Summer Season due to the Beard reducing the rate at which Wilson cools off.
  + Storing any [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") foods in your Beard Storage Slots will not anger [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") if you are near them.
* The Transmute Ore II Skill that converts Gold Nuggets into Nitre is a good way to create massive amounts of [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder"), by converting Meats into Eggs with a [Birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage"), then into Gold by trading with [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King"). Igniting a stack of 40 can deal 8000 damage to bosses and make dealing with them much easier.
