The following is a guide to all of the Crock Pot dishes. There are many crock pot dishes in this game that do not serve a very good purpose, as they give less hunger than all of the ingredients separately. So, this guide is a list of all the crock pot dishes, organized into what is most and least effective.

## Calculation[]

**Bonus Points**  
A crock pot dish must give more than the ingredients sacrificed to make it, and ideally be better than other dishes in some way. This can become irrelevant in times of extreme abundance, but it can be helpful in some situations to know the value of crock pot recipes.

The [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"), Health, and [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") gained from eating a crock pot dish, that you wouldn't have otherwise gained from eating the ingredients individually, can be regarded as the *Bonus Points*.

Examples:

* A meatballs recipe (62.5 [hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") points) consisting of four morsels (50 hunger points) gives 12.5 bonus hunger points.

* A meatballs recipe consisting of three carrots and a large meat (62.5 hunger points) does not give any bonus hunger points.

* A meatballs recipe consisting of three red caps and a monster meat (0 hunger points without a birdcage) gives 62.5 bonus hunger points.

* A fist full of jam recipe (37.5 hunger points) consisting of 4 berries (50 points when roasted) *deducts* 12.5 hunger points from the ingredients. Not worth it unless the berries are spoiled.

This method can also be applied to the health and sanity gain of recipes.

**Efficiency**  
Efficiency is a concept that only really matters in times of extreme scarcity (usually with modified game settings or in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") maps).

Your ability to make recipes, and thus, *ability to make bonus points*, depends on having enough of the right ingredients to continue doing so. If you have less of a certain ingredient than others, it becomes important to spend it wisely to obtain the most bonus points. *Efficiency* is simply a measurement of the number of bonus points you're getting for each instance of a given ingredient. Simply take the bonus points of the recipe, and divide that number by the number of a given ingredient involved in the recipe.

Examples:

* Two large meats and two morsels involved in a meaty stew recipe give 75 bonus hunger points. For every meaty stew recipe of this type, you receive 37.5 bonus points for every large meat invested.

* A meaty stew recipe using three large meats and a berry would give 62.5 bonus points. Every meat invested this way pulls in about 20.8 bonus points per meat.

* One large meat, two morsels, and a honey as a honey ham recipe give 15.625 bonus hunger points, which is how many you gain per large meat from this recipe.

**Inedible ingredients**  
Red caps, monster meat, and spoiled food have penalties that arguably make them inedible, while twigs simply cannot be consumed. Furthermore, [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") cannot eat any non-meat/non-egg foods (there are rare exceptions to this rule, like Taffy.) Making everything else inedible outside of recipes.

These ingredients technically have a value of zero, and using these ingredients first should be a priority since they cannot be eaten. But there is an important distinction to make. **You are improving the value of the ingredients, but you're not upgrading the total payout of the dish.** It still takes effort to intentionally gain these ingredients.

In addition, such ingredients can't always be considered to have a zero points value. If the ingredient isn't literally inedible (like twigs), it can be consumed if you're willing to accept the penalty. Furthermore, the [Birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage") can be used to convert any cooked meat or jerky into [Eggs](/wiki/Eggs "Eggs"), giving them a base value of at least 12.5 hunger when the birdcage is available. Additionally, [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") can eat monster meat without any penalties.

Tips

Before starting on the recipes themselves, here's a few basic things to know about the Crock Pot, for new players:

* Check the [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") page for a complete list of recipes. Pay special attention to ingredient order, since a recipe might not turn out the way you expect even if it seems you put in the correct ingredients.

* High point vegetables, such as [Corn](/wiki/Corn "Corn"), [Pumpkin](/wiki/Pumpkin "Pumpkin") or [Eggplant](/wiki/Eggplant "Eggplant"), should usually be eaten raw or cooked over a fire. You usually can't obtain a higher total value by including these high point items in a recipe. You might even want to consider cooking and eating [Durians](/wiki/Durian "Durian"), since the penalty can be manageable.

* Don't put more than 1 monster meat in a recipe, unless it contains at least 1 twig (excluding Kabobs). If you put 2 or more monster meats/durians in the crock pot, the recipe (almost) always comes out as [Monster Lasagna](/wiki/Monster_Lasagna "Monster Lasagna"), which drops health and sanity by 20 when consumed. However, monster lasagna cannot have twigs, which allows up to 2 to be included (3 makes [Wet Goop](/wiki/Wet_Goop "Wet Goop")). You can also feed a bird in a [Birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage") cooked monster meat to receive [Eggs](/wiki/Egg "Egg").

* Wet Goop works as a bait for [Traps](/wiki/Trap "Trap"). It can be created with four twigs in single player Don't starve (Using four twigs in Don't Starve Together will result in [Steamed Twigs](/wiki/Steamed_Twigs "Steamed Twigs"))

* You must also consider time expenditure. If it takes less time to gather ingredients for a lower points recipe, it could easily result in a better rate of points gain?

## Hunger Point Dishes[]

### [Mandrake Soup](/wiki/Mandrake_Soup "Mandrake Soup")[]

Mandrake

Twigs

Twigs

Twigs

Crock Pot

Mandrake Soup

**Restores:**  
Hunger 150, Health 100, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* Has no knock-out effect, unlike eating a Mandrake raw or cooked.
* Restores massive amount of hunger and health, plus a small sanity boost

**Cons:**

* The knock-out effect is generally desirable for crowd-control.
* Arguably a waste of a Mandrake that could be used in a [Prestihatitator](/wiki/Prestihatitator "Prestihatitator") in order to create a [Pan Flute](/wiki/Pan_Flute "Pan Flute")

**Using it best:**

* Only in emergencies, because Mandrakes are in limited supply.

### [DragonPie](/wiki/Dragon_Pie "Dragon Pie")[]

Dragon Fruit

Twigs

Twigs

Twigs

Crock Pot

Dragonpie

**Restores:**  
Hunger 75, Health 40, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* HP restoration is more than most hunger-point focused dishes.
* 15 day spoil-time makes it decent for long trips. You can stack a few of these to avoid needing to worry about food for a while.
* Chew time is relatively short, making it useful in fights to maintain health high.
* The best non-meat dish - can be carried safely around [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnymen "Bunnymen").

**Cons:**

* Requires a focused effort to produce en-masse. A [Birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage") and a good supply of [manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure") is needed.
* [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") cannot eat this dish, because she can only eat meats.

**Using it best:**

* If you can get production established, this can be your main food. This is made much easier by settling near [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo"). Other efficient manure-gathering means are gathering large quantities of petals / lightbulbs, transforming a [Pigman](/wiki/Pigman "Pigman") into a [Werepig](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig"), dropping the items on the floor and having him eat them; each one producing a manure.

Meaty Stew

* **Restores:**

Hunger 150, Health 12, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* Meaty stew provides the most hunger while also being made from reasonable ingredients.
* Also provides 25 degrees of heat in expansion content.
* Needs no special structures or tools aside from the crock pot.
* Stale meaty stew restores 100 hunger, still a very large amount, as long as you're not [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom").

**Cons:**

* Spoil time is fairly low, at 10 days (though stale meaty stew can be usable).
* Many characters do not have a maximum hunger sufficient to hold all 150 hunger points.
* Can be annoying and dangerous to manage eating Meaty Stew on the go, since you usually need to wait until hunger is empty to get the most out of it. Not being topped off can lead to you going into starvation at an inconvenient moment.
* Meaty stew , additionally, has a rather long chewing time.

**Using it best:**

* In situations of scarcity, this can enable you to stretch your food supplies very far. You can also [sleep](/wiki/Sleep "Sleep") with low hunger, and eat this on waking up to instantly gain maximum hunger. Meaty stew is not usually ideal for long travel, and is usually best used at home base.
* An upgraded [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") can make decent use of this dish, since they have a higher hunger capacity, as well as the perk of getting full value out of spoiled food.
* Meaty stew may seem ideal for [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang"), but the micromanagement of maintaining his forms combined with the timing issues of eating it can make this dish inconvenient for him.

### [Honey Ham](/wiki/Honey_Ham "Honey Ham")[]

Reign of Giants

**Restores:**  
Hunger 75, Health 30, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* Spoil-time is decent at 15 days.
* Slight warming effect in [Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants") can ward off freezing for a short time.

**Cons:**

* Needs ingredients from at least 3 different sources.
* Needs honey production needs to be established first for consistency.
* Not as long lasting as [Bacon and Eggs](/wiki/Bacon_and_Eggs "Bacon and Eggs").

**Using it best:**

* This can become a main food with the right setup. If you settle your camp near some morsel producing food sources, you can generally make it bibly, and morsels.

### [Bacon and Eggs](/wiki/Bacon_and_Eggs "Bacon and Eggs")[]

Morsel

Monster Meat

Egg

Egg

Crock Pot

Bacon and Eggs

Monster Meat

Monster Meat

Tallbird Egg

Twigs

Crock Pot

Bacon and Eggs

**Restores:**  
Hunger 75, Health 20, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* Has a very long spoil-time of 20 days.
* Can be made from monster meat and morsels.
* Is Wilson’s favorite food.

**Cons:**

* Long chewing time can make this a bit more dangerous to use in tight situations.
* Needs [birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage") to make consistently.

**Using it best:**

* This can become a main food with the right setup. If you settle your camp near some morsel producing food sources, you can generally make it using monster meat and a single morsel. As meat stores decay, you'll be inclined to turn them into eggs to preserve them, which will make this dish a means to utilize them.

### [Turkey Dinner](/wiki/Turkey_Dinner "Turkey Dinner")[]

Reign of Giants

**Restores:**  
Hunger 75, Health 20, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* A bit more flexible with ingredients than other dishes, and can be made purely off of berry production.
* Needs no special structures aside from the crock pot.
* Reign of Giants' [Buzzards](/wiki/Buzzards "Buzzards") make this a relatively easy dish to make (drop a piece of meat on the ground to bait them).
* Is Wigfrid’s favorite food.

**Cons:**

* The short spoil time of 6 days means that this food is not suitable for expeditions.
* Relies on resources that can be difficult to obtain. A large operation and good planning is required to farm [Gobblers](/wiki/Gobblers "Gobblers"), while [Pengulls](/wiki/Pengulls "Pengulls") don't drop them too often and can be dangerous to fight.

**Using it best:**

* Probably eat as an occasional treat, not as a main dish, except as a desert food in [RoG](/wiki/RoG "RoG").
* By setting up an 'Incredible Inedible' farm (surrounding a pen with a [Powdercake](/wiki/Powdercake "Powdercake") with berry bushes), drumsticks can be more easily attained.

Reign of Giants

**Restores:**  
Hunger 62.5, Health 3, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* The most flexible food of all. Meatballs can be made from nearly any ingredient combination. Just make sure you have at least one morsel or monster meat, and it will probably work.
* It can also turn trash into treasure. [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms"), [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat"), rotting food, red mushrooms, or [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice") can all become 62.5 points of hunger with no penalties.
* Needs no special structures or tools aside from the crock pot.

**Cons:**

* Only 10 days of spoil time means that you won't get far without having to deal with stale food. You also can't stockpile meatballs to preserve ingredients with much effectiveness.
* Virtually no HP restoration.

**Using it best:**

* Use this recipe when you have a lot of garbage food to get rid of. You can even make meatballs from cooked monster meat if you have a [birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage") to convert 3 of them to eggs.

### [Froggle Bunwich](/wiki/Froggle_Bunwich "Froggle Bunwich")[]

Reign of Giants

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 20, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* Can be made with 2 twigs, preserving other ingredients.
* Restores 20 HP per meal. You'll likely eat two per day, giving 40 HP and 10 sanity.
* The smaller hunger payout (which uses less ingredients) makes meal scheduling more flexible than with larger meals.
* 15 day spoil-time.

**Cons:**

* Inflexible recipe.
* [Frog Legs](/wiki/Frog_Legs "Frog Legs") typically come from dangerous biomes.
* Froggle Bunwiches are only worth making using smaller vegetables such as [Carrots](/wiki/Carrots "Carrots"), [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms"), or [Cactus Flesh](/wiki/Cactus_Flesh "Cactus Flesh"). Most of what is produced at a [Farm](/wiki/Farm "Farm") isn't worth making this dish with.
* Cooking up many of these can be a pain without several crock pots, with a 40 second cook time for each. This is compounded by needing to make more Froggle Bunwiches to equal other foods.

**Using it best:**

* If a fairy ring or [Desert](/wiki/Desert "Desert") biome is available nearby to a source of frog legs, you may be able to create Froggle Bunwiches on a regular basis. Otherwise, this should just be an occasional meal out of random frog legs and smaller vegetables. The presence of a [Birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage") means that [Dragon fruit](/wiki/Dragon_fruit "Dragon fruit") should usually occupy every farm plot eventually, obsoleting this dish.

**Pros:**

* Can be made with 2 twigs, preserving other ingredients.
* Restores 20 HP per meal. You'll likely eat two per day, giving 40 HP and 10 sanity.
* The smaller hunger payout (which uses less ingredients) makes meal scheduling more flexible than with larger meals.
* 15 day spoil-time.
* This is WX-78’s favorite food.

**Cons:**

* Inflexible recipe.
* Needs silk to establish a good butterfly farm.
* Butter Muffins are only worth making using smaller vegetables such as [Carrots](/wiki/Carrots "Carrots"), [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms"), or [Cactus Flesh](/wiki/Cactus_Flesh "Cactus Flesh"). Most of what is produced at a [Farm](/wiki/Farm "Farm") isn't worth making this dish with.
* Cooking up many of these can be a pain without several crock pots, with a 40 second cook time for each. This is compounded by needing to make more Butter Muffins to equal other foods.
* [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") can't eat this.

**Using it best:**

* If a fairy ring or [Desert](/wiki/Desert "Desert") biome is available, you may be able to set up a flower farm for butterfly wings in or near them. Otherwise, this should just be an occasional meal out of butterfly wings and random smaller vegetables. The presence of a [Birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage") means that [Dragon fruit](/wiki/Dragon_fruit "Dragon fruit") should usually occupy every farm plot eventually, obsoleting this dish.

Reign of Giants

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 20, Sanity 0

**Pros:**

* Can be made with 2 twigs, preserving other ingredients.
* Restores 20 HP per meal. You'll likely eat two per day, giving 40 HP.
* The smaller hunger payout (which uses less ingredients) makes meal scheduling more flexible than with larger meals.
* 10 day spoil-time.
* Unlike its peers, it isn't too tough to farm the ingredients for this. Transplant live [Moleworms](/wiki/Moleworms "Moleworms") to the [Desert](/wiki/Desert "Desert") biome, and you'll be able to farm every ingredient you need to make this dish.
* Cook time is much faster than other 37.5 hunger foods, at 10 seconds.
* Production doesn't need special buildings aside from the crock pot. Only needs a [Hammer](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer") to stun a [Moleworm](/wiki/Moleworm "Moleworm") for transport.

**Cons:**

* Inflexible recipe.
* Spoil-time is only 10 days.

**Using it best:**

* If the desert appeals to you, this is the food of choice to make there. You can forgo a lot of base building staples until you want longer lasting food to take on expeditions.

## Something Sweet For Health[]

### [Waffles](/wiki/Waffles "Waffles")[]

Butter

Egg

Berries

Twigs

Crock Pot

Waffles

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 60, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* 60 HP restoration.

**Cons:**

* Requires [Butter](/wiki/Butter "Butter"), a rare drop from [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterflies "Butterflies").
* [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") can't eat this.

**Using it best:**

* An occasional treat from a butterfly farm.

**Restores:**  
Hunger 12.5, Health 40, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* 40 HP recovery.
* Easy to make, under the right conditions.

**Cons:**

* Can only be made with ingredients from the desert, one of which only grows in the summer.
* The spoil-time is only 6 days, so it can't be stockpiled.
* If [Moleworms](/wiki/Moleworms "Moleworms") are established well enough, [Guacamole](/wiki/Guacamole "Guacamole") obsoletes this.
* [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") can't eat this.

**Using it best:**

* A decent HP restoring option for desert camping, if you lack [Moleworms](/wiki/Moleworms "Moleworms"), or are loaded with cactus parts.

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 40, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* 40 HP recovery.
* Flexible filler, can use honey, ice, mushrooms, or even two monster meats.

**Cons:**

* Spoil-time is 10 days, half as much as a [pierogi](/wiki/Pierogi "Pierogi").
* Needs fish, and possibly silk as a result.

**Using it best:**

* If you have access to [Fish](/wiki/Fish "Fish"), you can whip this up for some quick HP. It can usually be said to use less edible food to make than other recipes, making it more ideal for just healing at base.
* Please see the Ocean Related Recipes section for more on using [Fish](/wiki/Fish "Fish") to their full potential.

**Pros:**

* 40 HP recovery.
* Spoil-time is 20 days.

**Cons:**

* More stingy with the necessary ingredients: needs a [Birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage"), meat, and a vegetable to use.
* Ideally made using smaller vegetables such as [Carrots](/wiki/Carrots "Carrots"), [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms"), or [Cactus Flesh](/wiki/Cactus_Flesh "Cactus Flesh"). [Farms](/wiki/Farm "Farm") don't usually produce small vegetables.

**Using it best:**

* These can be used for stockpiling healing items for long trips, and a backup meal if you run out of other food somehow. If 15 days spoil-time is sufficient, [Dragonpie](/wiki/Dragonpie "Dragonpie") might be a better choice, if available.

**Restores:**  
Hunger 12.5, Health 30, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* Made from relatively common ingredients likely found in the same biome.
* No special structures or tools needed; a crock pot and an axe are enough.
* Spoil-time is a decent 15 days.

**Cons:**

* Vastly less hunger restoration than other HP restoring dishes.
* [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") can't eat this.

**Using it best:**

* This is the most available HP restoring food in the game (in [Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")). Great for the early game. It isn't tough to farm, either, and will last on long trips.

**Pros:**

* Spoil-time of 15 days.
* No special tools or resources required (you must at least kill bees or destroy [hives](/wiki/Beehives "Beehives") to get honey).

**Cons:**

* Changing the meat out for a fish, and one of the other ingredients for a twig doubles the HP gained by creating [Fishsticks](/wiki/Fishsticks "Fishsticks").
* Honey is required for regular production.

**Using it best:**

* If you knock down a hive early on, before establishing other production, you can use the resulting honey with some meat for a quick bit of HP. For long-term production, making this instead of other dishes can save you a lot of time provided you have honey stockpiled.

**Pros:**

* HP restoration using only fruit.
* Easier in Shipwrecked DLC, where coconuts are abundant.

**Cons:**

* Producing this on purpose through crops is madness. Dragon fruit and [Pomegranates](/wiki/Pomegranates "Pomegranates") can accomplish the same thing, but more easily.
* Spoil-time of 6 days.
* [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") can't eat this.

**Using it best:**

* This dish can be thrown together with certain fruits on occasion. Do not make this with [pomegranates](/wiki/Pomegranates "Pomegranates"), they restore 20 HP *each* when fire-cooked.

Hunger 37.5, Health 20, Sanity 0

**Pros:**

* Chili, like [Dragonpie](/wiki/Dragonpie "Dragonpie"), gives the player 40 degrees of heat when eaten.
* Special structures and tools are unnecessary to make this.

**Cons:**

* Spoil-time of 10 days.
* [Guacamole](/wiki/Guacamole "Guacamole") is superior in almost every way.
* Same problems as other vegetable recipes: ok in the short term when using random red caps or carrots, but farming the ingredients for it only really makes sense in limited situations.
* Requires 1.5 meats and 1.5 vegetables, forcing the use of higher quality ingredients. A two red-cap recipe will not work.

**Using it best:**

* Much like the fruit medley, this food can be put together with random ingredients early on. Most of the time however, there are better options unless you want the warming effect.

### [Ice Cream](/wiki/Ice_Cream "Ice Cream")[]

Dairy product

Ice

Sweetener

Sweetener

Crock Pot

Ice Cream

Reign of Giants

**Restores:**  
Hunger 25, Health 0, Sanity 50

**Pros:**

* Best food-based sanity restoration in the game in *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")*, but tied with [Jelly Salad](/wiki/Jelly_Salad "Jelly Salad") in DST.
* Reduces temperature by 40 degrees.

**Cons:**

* Rare dairy ingredient requirement.
* [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") can't eat this.

**Using it best:**

* A nice way to fix sanity and cool off, but nothing to be relied upon.

### [Melonsicle](/wiki/Melonsicle "Melonsicle")[]

Watermelon

Ice

Twigs

Twigs

Crock Pot

Melonsicle

Reign of Giants

**Restores:**  
Hunger 12.5, Health 3, Sanity 20

**Pros:**

* Relatively easy sanity restoration for warm weather, provided ice supplies are stocked up and [farms](/wiki/Farms "Farms") are producing [Watermelons](/wiki/Watermelon "Watermelon").
* Reduces temperature by 40 degrees.

**Cons:**

* [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") can't eat this.
* Could cause some problems in winter.
* Only lasts 3 days (you can keep the ingredients in storage to avoid this issue).
* Needs [farming](/wiki/Farming "Farming") to work (but can be worth it).

**Using it best:**

* If anything can dethrone [Dragonpie](/wiki/Dragonpie "Dragonpie") as the thing to use farms for, it's this recipe. This dish can replace [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy") as the main Sanity restoring food for expansion content. Melonsicles can even be used in winter so long as you have a roaring fire going to warm back up with.

Honey

Taffy

**Restores:**  
Hunger 25, Health -3, Sanity 15

**Pros:**

* An established honey producing base can easily make more than enough honey to make Taffy on a regular basis, enabling you to recover all of your sanity this way.

**Cons:**

* The -3 HP penalty isn't exactly stellar (though easy to offset by eating a single honey).
* Needs honey production.
* Other methods of sanity restoration may be better, especially in [Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants").
* [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") can't eat this.( she can in DST)

**Using it best:**

* Make Taffy, then eat a honey to offset the health loss. Don't make [Pumpkin Cookies](/wiki/Pumpkin_Cookies "Pumpkin Cookies"); instead, make Taffy, and just fire-cook the pumpkin. The end result is more hunger restored, and the health penalty is offset by the pumpkin.

## Leafy Meat Dishes[]

The following are some of the crock-pot recipes that use leafy meat. Some are better than others, and serve different purposes. Whether prioritising farming [Leafy Meat](/wiki/Leafy_Meat "Leafy Meat") is advised or not is debateable, but for those times when [Lureplants](/wiki/Lureplants "Lureplants") are on your side, knowing the meals you can make with them helps.

### [Beefy Greens](/wiki/Beefy_Greens "Beefy Greens")[]

Leafy Meat

Vegetables

Beefy Greens

**Restores:**  
Hunger 75, Health 40, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* This technically counts as a meat item, so [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") will eat it.

**Cons:**

* [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt") will refuse to eat this.

**Using it best:**

* Mushrooms only count as 0.5 vegetables each, and this dish requires 3. As such, you must use vegetables with values of at least 1 each.

### [Jelly Salad](/wiki/Jelly_Salad "Jelly Salad")[]

Leafy Meat

Leafy Meat

Sweetener

Sweetener

Crock Pot

Jelly Salad

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 0, Sanity 50

**Pros:**

* Due to [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") not being able to eat [Ice Cream](/wiki/Ice_Cream "Ice Cream") or Cooked Green Caps, this is a very viable Sanity food.

**Cons:**

* To produce this consistently, a reliable source of honey would be needed. While the sanity gained is large, it's debateable if this is worth it.

**Using it best:**

* [Royal Jelly](/wiki/Royal_Jelly "Royal Jelly") can also be used to create this - although it is strongly advised that you do not.

### [Veggie Burger](/wiki/Veggie_Burger "Veggie Burger")[]

Leafy Meat

Onions

Vegetables

Filler

Crock Pot

Veggie Burger

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 30, Sanity 33

**Pros:**

* Decent all-round food item, providing both health and sanity (with minimal hunger)
* Despite it being a 'veggie' burger, [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") is able to eat this. Clearly the chef should be proud.

**Cons:**

* [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt") will refuse to eat this.

**Using it best:**

* As 1 vegetable (aside from onion) is required, two mushrooms can be used.

### [Leafy Meatloaf](/wiki/Leafy_Meatloaf "Leafy Meatloaf")[]

Leafy Meatloaf

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 8, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* Can be made out of essentially anything as long as you have two leafy meat.
* [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") is able to eat this.

**Cons:**

* You get almost nothing from eating this.
* [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt") will (understandably) refuse to eat this.

**Using it best:**

* Don't make it.

## Ocean Related Dishes[]

With the [*Return of Them*](/wiki/Return_of_Them "Return of Them") update and sea based dishes from [*Shipwrecked*](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked"), there were a few [Barnacle](/wiki/Barnacle "Barnacle") / [Fish](/wiki/Fish "Fish") related Crock Pot dishes that got added.

#### [Fishsticks](/wiki/Fishsticks "Fishsticks")[]

Fishes

Twigs

Filler

Filler

Crock Pot

Fishsticks

Hunger37.5 Health40 Sanity5

Pros:

* Cheap to prepare during early game.
* Can be used to get [Kittykit](/wiki/Critters "Critters") in [*Don't Starve Together*](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together").

Cons:

* Sticks can't be used as filler.

Using it best:

* Particularly good for health regen. Useful when playing as [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly"), as he is able to prepare healing food early in the game.

### [Stuffed Fish Heads](/wiki/Stuffed_Fish_Heads "Stuffed Fish Heads")[]

Barnacle

Fishes

Filler

Filler

Crock Pot

Stuffed Fish Heads

**Restores:**  
Hunger 75, Health 20, Sanity 0

**Pros:**

* Strong food for hunger replenishment.
* Two of the ingredients are able to be filler. Very cheap.

**Cons:**

* Adding any vegetables may result in creating (the inferior) [Barnacle Pita](/wiki/Barnacle_Pita "Barnacle Pita")

**Using it best:**

* Seeing as half of the dish can be made of filler (twigs, ice etc) it's a reasonably cheap dish that still provides 75 hunger. Get yourself a good source of [barnacles](/wiki/Barnacle "Barnacle"), go fishing and you'll make yourself enough food for the season.

### [Barnacle Linguine](/wiki/Barnacle_Linguine "Barnacle Linguine")[]

Barnacle

Barnacle

Vegetables

Vegetables

Crock Pot

Barnacle Linguine

**Restores:**  
Hunger 75, Health 10, Sanity 20

**Pros:**

* Good amount of hunger and sanity for something that's only two [barnacles](/wiki/Barnacles "Barnacles") and two vegetables.

**Cons:**

* Requires two [barnacles](/wiki/Barnacle "Barnacle") and only provides 10 health.

**Using it best:**

* Get yourself a good renewable source of [barnacles](/wiki/Barnacles "Barnacles") (maybe migrate some [Sea Weed](/wiki/Sea_Weed "Sea Weed")) and this is a very strong food item.

### [Barnacle Nigiri](/wiki/Barnacle_Nigiri "Barnacle Nigiri")[]

Barnacle

Kelp Frond

Eggs

Filler

Crock Pot

Barnacle Nigiri

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 40, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* Good Health food, although it requires three ingredients that require some extra work to obtain. But for the effort, you get rewarded.

**Cons:**

* Minimal Hunger and Sanity gains from this item.

**Using it best:**

* The amount of effort required is quite a lot; many other Health food items are around that provide the same (or more) Health and Hunger, such as [Dragonpies](/wiki/Dragonpie "Dragonpie") and [Pierogi](/wiki/Pierogi "Pierogi").

### [Barnacle Pita](/wiki/Barnacle_Pita "Barnacle Pita")[]

Barnacle

Vegetables

Filler

Filler

Crock Pot

Barnacle Pita

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 20, Sanity 5

**Pros:**

* It is a very cheap dish to make that still provides a reasonable 20 health.

**Cons:**

* This is commonly made accidentally when trying to create [Stuffed Fish Heads](/wiki/Stuffed_Fish_Heads "Stuffed Fish Heads").

**Using it best:**

* While it is very cheap to make and provides 20 Health, for only a little more effort, better dishes can be cooked. This is not a recommended dish.

### [California Roll](/wiki/California_Roll "California Roll")[]

Fishes

Kelp Frond

Kelp Frond

Filler

Crock Pot

California Roll

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 20, Sanity 10

**Pros:**

* Cheap dish to create, and provides a reasonable 20 Health for that.

**Cons:**

* Low Hunger gains from this dish.

**Using it best:**

* This is able to be given to the [Yaarctopus](/wiki/Yaarctopus "Yaarctopus") in exchange for a [Thatch Sail](/wiki/Thatch_Sail "Thatch Sail").
* Using a [Shark Fin](/wiki/Shark_Fin "Shark Fin") as a filler may yield [Shark Fin Soup](/wiki/Shark_Fin_Soup "Shark Fin Soup") instead.
* Using a [Wobster](/wiki/Wobster "Wobster") for the fish requirement then using Ice or Butter as a filler will yield [Lobster Bisque](/wiki/Lobster_Bisque "Lobster Bisque") and [Lobster Dinner](/wiki/Lobster_Dinner "Lobster Dinner") respectively.
* The [California Roll](/wiki/California_Roll "California Roll") was invented to popularize sushi in North America. To become appetizing for people who did not like seeing seaweed, it's prepared "inside out", where the seaweed is inside and the rice is outside of the roll. However, the in-game image for California Roll has the seaweed outside, indicating it's not actually a California Roll.

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 60, Sanity 33

**Pros:**

* This is [Wickerbottom's](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom") favourite food, granting her 52.5 hunger regained, compared to the regular 37.5.
* Considering how cheap it is, the 60 Health gained along with 33 Sanity is more than welcome.

**Cons:**

* Only 37.5 Hunger provided (although this is clearly offset by the other benefits).
* Ice is not able to be used.

**Using it best:**

* This is able to be given to the [Yaarctopus](/wiki/Yaarctopus "Yaarctopus") in exchange for a [Boat Lantern](/wiki/Boat_Lantern "Boat Lantern").

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 40, Sanity 20

**Pros:**

* While the Health and Hunger restoration is comparable to that of [Fishsticks](/wiki/Fishsticks "Fishsticks"), the Sanity restoration is much higher.

**Cons:**

* Low Hunger restoration.

**Using it best:**

* This is able to be given to the [Yaarctopus](/wiki/Yaarctopus "Yaarctopus") in exchange for a [Cloth Sail](/wiki/Cloth_Sail "Cloth Sail").
* Changing essentially any of the items in this will most commonly lead to [Surf 'n' Turf](/wiki/Surf_%27n%27_Turf "Surf 'n' Turf") and [Stuffed Fish Heads](/wiki/Stuffed_Fish_Heads "Stuffed Fish Heads"), but could also lead to [Lobster Dinner](/wiki/Lobster_Dinner "Lobster Dinner"), [California Rolls](/wiki/California_Roll "California Roll"), [Shark Fin Soups](/wiki/Shark_Fin_Soup "Shark Fin Soup"), and even [Bacon and Eggs](/wiki/Bacon_and_Eggs "Bacon and Eggs").

### [Wobster Bisque](/wiki/Wobster_Bisque "Wobster Bisque")[]

Wobster (DST)

Ice

Filler

Filler

Crock Pot

Wobster Bisque (DST)

**Restores:**  
Hunger 25, Health 60, Sanity 10

**Pros:**

* This provides 60 Health restoration, which for a recipe with two Filler items, is very generous.

**Cons:**

* Low Hunger and Sanity provided.

**Using it best:**

* [Woodie's](/wiki/Woodie_quotes "Woodie quotes") quote for this dish is 'Looks so smooth and creamy, but I'd still prefer salmon'.

### [Wobster Dinner](/wiki/Wobster_Dinner "Wobster Dinner")[]

Wobster (DST)

Butter

Filler

Filler

Crock Pot

Wobster Dinner (DST)

**Restores:**  
Hunger 37.5, Health 60, Sanity 50

**Pros:**

* This is [Maxwell's](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell") favourite dish, granting him 52.5 Hunger, rather than the regular 37.5
* Significant Health and Sanity restoration (largely due to the cost of [Butter](/wiki/Butter "Butter"))

**Cons:**

* Requires [Butter](/wiki/Butter "Butter") to create.

**Using it best:**

* This is able to be given to the [Yaarctopus](/wiki/Yaarctopus "Yaarctopus") in exchange for a [Boat Cannon](/wiki/Boat_Cannon "Boat Cannon").
* [Warly's](/wiki/Warly_quotes "Warly quotes") quote for this dish is 'No Place is too remote for some fine dining!', likely due to his original quote referencing the setting of [Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked").

## Low Worth Dishes[]

Most of these are only worthwhile to upgrade freshness of stale or spoiled ingredients, for the 5 sanity almost every dish can get, or to put some variety into [Warly's](/wiki/Warly "Warly") varied diet as he gets higher benefits from Crock Pot recipes but lower benefits from separate ingredients.

### [Fish Tacos](/wiki/Fish_Tacos "Fish Tacos")[]

Fish Tacos

Can easily become [Fishsticks](/wiki/Fishsticks "Fishsticks"), a much more worthwhile dish.

### [Unagi](/wiki/Unagi "Unagi")[]

Unagi

Another instance where the recipe can easily become [Fishsticks](/wiki/Fishsticks "Fishsticks").

### [Fist Full of Jam](/wiki/Fist_Full_of_Jam "Fist Full of Jam")[]

Fist Full of Jam

[Fist Full of Jam](/wiki/Fist_Full_of_Jam "Fist Full of Jam") gives less hunger than the involved ingredients, unless ice is used. Even in that case, Meatballs are better. Worth it for [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt").

### [Kabobs](/wiki/Kabobs "Kabobs")[]

Kabobs

Some combinations of ingredients can turn a profit when spent on [Kabobs](/wiki/Kabobs "Kabobs"), but those same ingredients are better spent on [meatballs](/wiki/Meatballs "Meatballs").

### [Stuffed Eggplant](/wiki/Stuffed_Eggplant "Stuffed Eggplant")[]

Stuffed Eggplant

[Stuffed Eggplant](/wiki/Stuffed_Eggplant "Stuffed Eggplant") is generally a waste of twigs, as it normally provides no bonus hunger. It can be used to convert inedibles into hunger points, but there are more profitable ways.

### [Ratatouille](/wiki/Ratatouille "Ratatouille")[]

Ratatouille

Most [Ratatouille](/wiki/Ratatouille "Ratatouille") recipes give less stat restoration than its individual components. That being said, in an emergency this is an ok way to spend multiple red caps (but far from the best use of them). Ice can also make this dish pay out more than the input, but [meatballs](/wiki/Meatballs "Meatballs") is once again the superior dish to spend these ingredients on. Worth it for [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt").

### [Monster Lasagna](/wiki/Monster_Lasagna "Monster Lasagna")[]

Monster Lasagna

[Monster Lasagna](/wiki/Monster_Lasagna "Monster Lasagna") is only really worth it for [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber")/[Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba"), and only if their cooked monster meats are about to spoil. There are usually far better ways to spend monster meat.

### [Powdercake](/wiki/Powdercake "Powdercake")[]

Powdercake

Powdercake

[Powdercake](/wiki/Powdercake "Powdercake") is a joke item, which takes 3 health when eaten. It can, however, be used as an extremely long-lasting bait for [Tooth Traps](/wiki/Tooth_Traps "Tooth Traps"), and also can be used to apply Warly's powders. It's most common use is in 'Incredible Inedibles', which are berry bush / Gobbler farms.

### [Wet Goop](/wiki/Wet_Goop "Wet Goop")[]

Wet Goop

[Wet Goop](/wiki/Wet_Goop "Wet Goop") is made whenever an invalid recipe is made. Wet Goop has no positive, or negative effects on the player, and lasts 6 days before it spoils. Other than bait for some mobs, it's completely useless.
