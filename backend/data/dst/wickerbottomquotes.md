## PlaceholderTrivia[]

* Wickerbottom's examination quote for the [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter") is a reference to the Scottish folk song, "[Auld Lang Syne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne "wikipedia:Auld Lang Syne")".
* The quote for Thulecite Walls ("My pockets must be bigger on the inside.") is possibly a reference to *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who "wikipedia:Doctor Who")*, in which nearly every new companion utters the sentence "It's bigger on the inside" whenever they first enter the [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS "wikipedia:TARDIS").
* Wickerbottom's quote for [Cave Bananas](/wiki/Cave_Banana "Cave Banana") is a reference to the fact that most bananas commercially available are genetically identical due to the genetic modification to remove banana seeds.
* Wickerbottom's quote for the [Wardrobe](/wiki/Wardrobe "Wardrobe"), "This reminds me of a famous book," is a possible reference to the fantasy Novel *[The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe "wikipedia:The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe")* by [C. S. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis "wikipedia:C. S. Lewis").
* Wickerbottom's quote for the White Whale is a reference to [Moby-Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick "wikipedia:Moby-Dick"), the legendary whale and antagonist of the book with the same name.
* Her quote for Maxwell as a murderer ("Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice - you're dead!") is a variant of the saying "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
* Wickerbottom's quote for [Fried Doydoy Eggs](/wiki/Fried_Doydoy_Egg "Fried Doydoy Egg"), "Green eggs and ham", is a reference to the [book of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Eggs_and_Ham "wikipedia:Green Eggs and Ham").
* Wickerbottom's quote for a regular Doydoy Egg ("Nature always finds a way.") is a reference to *[Jurassic Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film) "wikipedia:Jurassic Park (film)")*.
* Wickerbottom's current quote for the [Cave Cleft](/wiki/Cave_Cleft "Cave Cleft") ("The natural habitat of a the Mammalian Hematophagous.") mistakenly contains more [determiners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determiner "wikipedia:Determiner") than needed (both "a" and "the").
* Wickerbottom's quote for [Fossil Fragment](/wiki/Fossils "Fossils"), ("Hardened remains preserved by taphonomic processes.") is about [Taphonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taphonomy). The study of decay of living things and it's fossilization in palaeontology.
  + Interestingly, the term was coined in 1940 by Soviet scientist Ivan Efremov, which is over 20 years after Wickerbottom was captured to the constant *if* according to earth timeline. While Wickerbottom works in deep knowledge, based on her Animated Short, it still begs the question on how she knows about future history.
