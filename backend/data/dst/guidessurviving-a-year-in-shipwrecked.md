This guide is intended to help players build land bases with the other seasons in mind.

Part 1: Compacting

The first prep for future seasons happens when you are about to settle down. Once you find a satisfactory island, pick a spot on the coast. Why the coast? Because then you have less to sandbag in order to protect your base. When you place down your first base structure, put it as close to the water as the game will let you. If done properly, you should have a bonus of chests openable from land and water. DO NOT do this with your [Fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire") pit/[Chiminea](/wiki/Chiminea "Chiminea"). Otherwise, those structures may be unusable. Instead, place your fire pit/chiminea in the middle of your base. the more you compact, the less flooring and sandbags are required.

Part 2: Flooring

Why do you need artificial flooring?.You need it to prevent puddles from spawning in your base during Monsoon season. You can make a piece of [Wooden Flooring](/wiki/Wooden_Flooring "Wooden Flooring") from one [Board](/wiki/Boards "Boards"), and a piece of [Snakeskin Rug](/wiki/Snakeskin_Rug "Snakeskin Rug") for two [Snakeskin](/wiki/Snakeskin "Snakeskin") and one [Cloth](/wiki/Cloth "Cloth"). If your world is connected to RoG and/or Hamlet, you can import crafted [Turfs](/wiki/Turfs "Turfs") from those worlds. [Beard Hair Rug](/wiki/Beard_Hair_Rug "Beard Hair Rug") IS floodproof.

Part 3: Rainproof Gear

This is the first prep that effects both seasons. A [Snakeskin Hat](/wiki/Snakeskin_Hat "Snakeskin Hat") and [Jacket](/wiki/Snakeskin_Jacket "Snakeskin Jacket"), as well as a [Palm Leaf Hut](/wiki/Palm_Leaf_Hut "Palm Leaf Hut"), are a must. wearing both snakeskin attire makes you immune to [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness"). the snakeskin also keeps you from being struck by [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning"). the palm leaf hut allows you to wear your [Backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") at home, due to it's 100% water resistance. Do not do this as [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber"), as you cannot also wear the [Shamlet Mask](/wiki/Shamlet_Mask "Shamlet Mask"). Use a [Tar](/wiki/Tar_Suit "Tar Suit") or [Blubber Suit](/wiki/Blubber_Suit "Blubber Suit") instead.

Part 4: [Sandbags](/wiki/Sandbag "Sandbag")

What are sandbags for if you have flooring? Sandbags prevent puddles from spreading, flooring prevents puddles from starting. Sandbags are crafted with two cloth and two [Sand](/wiki/Sand "Sand"). One cloth is three [Bamboo](/wiki/Bamboo "Bamboo"). Either wall yourself in entirely and get out by [Boat](/wiki/Boats "Boats"), or make a long and complicated hallway lined with sandbags and with flooring underneath. You may hammer your sandbags during dry season for easier mobility. this will yield sand, but no cloth, forcing you to collect that again.

What next?

You've prepared for two of the three major seasons, and you need the time of those seasons to prepare for the fourth, the [Dry](/wiki/Seasons/Dry "Seasons/Dry") season. what can you do?

Part 1: [Volcano](/wiki/Volcano "Volcano")

Find the volcano. It not only houses the [Obsidian Workbench](/wiki/Obsidian_Workbench "Obsidian Workbench"), which you should always find, but also [Woodleg](/wiki/Woodlegs "Woodlegs")'s cage if not already freed, and most importantly the [Volcano Altar of Snackrifice](/wiki/Volcano_Altar_of_Snackrifice "Volcano Altar of Snackrifice"). If fed the correct items, this structure will delay [Volcanic Eruptions](/wiki/Volcanic_Eruption "Volcanic Eruption"). The volcano also does not spawn puddles, so it could be an alternative way of dealing with that season. The easiest way to find the volcano is to find the [Rainbow Jellyfish](/wiki/Rainbow_Jellyfish "Rainbow Jellyfish") migration on a new moon and go the opposite way it is.

Part 2: Fight the [Tiger Shark](/wiki/Tiger_Shark "Tiger Shark")

In the monsoon season the tiger shark will return to it's [Sharkitten Den](/wiki/Sharkitten_Den "Sharkitten Den") and have babies. why is this important? The tiger shark and [Sharkittens](/wiki/Sharkitten "Sharkitten") drop [Shark Gills](/wiki/Shark_Gills "Shark Gills"), gills make the [Dumbrella](/wiki/Dumbrella "Dumbrella"), the dumbrella is like a Shipwrecked [Eyebrella](/wiki/Eyebrella "Eyebrella").

You're done! you should be able to survive one year in shipwrecked!
