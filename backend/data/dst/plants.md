| --- | --- |
| Tree | **[Evergreen](/wiki/Evergreen "Evergreen")** Can be found nearly everywhere. Cut down with the [Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe"), which drops 1-3 [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log") and 1-2 [Pine Cones](/wiki/Pine_Cone "Pine Cone") and leaves behind a stump that can be dug up with the [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel"), yielding one extra Log. Occasionally, nearby Trees may turn into [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard") when a tree is chopped down. |
| Tree | **[Lumpy Evergreen](/wiki/Lumpy_Evergreen "Lumpy Evergreen")** Lumpy Evergreens are a variant of the typical evergreen with lumpy and wilted-looking branches. Unlike normal Evergreens, the Lumpy variety does not produce Pine Cones, leading characters to wonder how it reproduces at all. They still have a life-cycle, growing to huge trees and then reverting to small ones. Also like normal trees, lumpy ones can become Treeguards. |
| Tree | **[Spiky Tree](/wiki/Spiky_Tree "Spiky Tree")** These trees are exclusively found in the [Marsh](/wiki/Marsh "Marsh") Biome. These trees don't have a life-cycle. When cut down with an [Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe") it will drop a [Twig](/wiki/Twig "Twig") and they have a 20% chance of dropping a log. The stump also yields a log like the others. The [Spiky Tree](/wiki/Spiky_Tree "Spiky Tree") and the [Cave Banana Tree](/wiki/Cave_Banana_Tree "Cave Banana Tree") are the only [trees](/wiki/Trees "Trees") that drop [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs"). |
| Totally Normal Tree | **[Totally Normal Tree](/wiki/Totally_Normal_Tree "Totally Normal Tree")** The Totally Normal Tree is a tree found in the Forest Biome. It can be chopped down, to give the player 2 Living Logs. The player can then use a Shovel to dig up the stump to gain an additional Living Log. If burned, it will drop [Charcoal](/wiki/Charcoal "Charcoal") when chopped just like other burned trees. These trees will have a randomized number of [Evil Flowers](/wiki/Evil_Flowers "Evil Flowers") growing near them. When cutting it down, it will make a groaning/moaning noise with every chop. |
| Sapling | **[Sapling](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling")** Often found in [Forest](/wiki/Forest "Forest") and [Grasslands](/wiki/Grasslands "Grasslands") [Biomes](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes"). Can be harvested by hand, which yields one [Twig](/wiki/Twig "Twig"). Can be dug with a [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel") to replant. No fertilizing is required for growth after planting. |
| Berry Bush | **[Berry Bush](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush")** Can be found in a number of Biomes, most notably Grasslands and Forest. Can be harvested by hand, which yields one [Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries"). Can be dug with a Shovel to collect a [Berry Bush](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush") that the player may plant or use to make a [Bush Hat](/wiki/Bush_Hat "Bush Hat"). Fertilizing with [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure") or [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot") is required for growth after planting. After a few harvests, the Berry Bush will need to be re-fertilized to continue growth. |
| Grass Tuft | **[Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass")** Commonly found in Grasslands, [Savanna](/wiki/Savanna "Savanna") and rarely in Forest Biomes. Can be harvested by hand, which yields one [Cut Grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass"). Can be dug with a Shovel to collect a [Grass Tuft](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft") that the player may plant.

It can be harvested by hand, which yields one [Twig](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs"), but also causes 3 damage. This can be avoided by digging it up with a [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel") and replanting it. Spiky bushes are really useful in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") levels *Archipelago* and *The King of Winter*, because they grow back even during winter. |

Chopping leaves a stump, which can be dug with a Shovel for an additional Log. Setting the tree on fire, then chopping it will produce 1 Charcoal, whether or not the Cave Banana is still on the tree when burned. Chopped or burned Cave Banana Trees do not respawn, making them a nonrenewable resource in a Cave. |
| Mushrooms | **[Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms")** Each of the three mushrooms can be hand picked at different times of the day ([Red Mushroom](/wiki/Red_Mushroom "Red Mushroom") during the [Day](/wiki/Day "Day"), [Green Mushroom](/wiki/Green_Mushroom "Green Mushroom") during the [Dusk](/wiki/Dusk "Dusk"), and [Blue Mushroom](/wiki/Blue_Mushroom "Blue Mushroom") during the [Night](/wiki/Night "Night")), which then re-grow after 10–20 hours of [rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain"). They can also be dug up with a [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel"), at any time of day - this will yield two mushrooms, but mushroom spawn will be destroyed. Mushrooms don't regrow during winter. |

Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts and Saplings.

 

Collectible plants ([Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft"), [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush"), [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling")) are Plants the player can pick up after digging them up with a [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel").

Transplanted plants and some Trees in [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") and [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") will grow and function normally as if they were in the [Surface](/wiki/Surface_World "Surface World") and they don't need any type Light Source.

In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* DLC, during [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") most ground plants wilt due to heat and therefore cannot be harvested. Plants can be protected from heat by an [Ice Flingomatic](/wiki/Ice_Flingomatic "Ice Flingomatic"). In [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"), the frequent [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") causes most plants to grow faster and produce fruit more frequently. Caves and Ruins are also affected by the current season in the Surface, meaning the plants will stop growing in [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter") and wilt during [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer").

In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* DLC, [Strong Winds](/wiki/Strong_Winds "Strong Winds") during [Hurricane Season](/wiki/Hurricane_Season "Hurricane Season"), may "harvest" some ground plants or even take down some trees. [Dry Season](/wiki/Dry_Season "Dry Season") and [Monsoon Season](/wiki/Monsoon_Season "Monsoon Season") have the same effects on the plants as their corresponding *Reign of Giants* seasons, [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") and [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring") respectively.
