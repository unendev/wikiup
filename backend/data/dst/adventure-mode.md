–[WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78")

**Adventure Mode** is the story mode of *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")*. In Adventure Mode, the player enters a battle of wits and endurance against the game's mastermind, [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(NPC) "Maxwell (NPC)"). The world is split into successive chapters with their own themes, introduced by Maxwell. The objective of each chapter is to survive, gather all four pieces of the [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing"), assemble it, and activate the device in order to progress to the next chapter.

Players can take up to four items of their choice with them when teleporting between chapters. [Wilson's Beard](/wiki/Wilson%27s_Beard "Wilson's Beard") doesn't count as an item, so it's maintained. [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78")'s stat increases from eating [Gears](/wiki/Gears "Gears") are also carried over between chapters. Any character-specific item will also be replaced, meaning the player does not necessarily have to bring such items with them. Also, any built but not yet placed structures will carry over with the player, ready to be deployed in the next world.

## Entering Adventure Mode[]

The player reaches Adventure Mode from [Sandbox Mode](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode") by activating [Maxwell's Door](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door"). The player is not allowed to bring anything over from Sandbox Mode (including learned recipes). Visiting Adventure Mode always starts the player at the very first chapter and a newly generated map, irrespective of previous attempts.

At the start of each level and every time the player loads up an Adventure game, the title of the level is displayed and the number of chapter. The length of Adventure Mode is 5 chapters plus an Epilogue. The order of appearance for most worlds is chosen at random. However, in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th world, the map will show some of the path indicating where the objectives are. A world only appears once in an Adventure play-through, but there are more worlds than chapters, which means that some worlds may not appear. There are 72 possible combinations of these 5 levels.

For more tips on all chapters, please check [Guides/Adventure Guide](/wiki/Guides/Adventure_Guide "Guides/Adventure Guide").

### A Cold Reception[]

:   **May appear on chapters 1 - 3**

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/23/Maxwell Greeting Adventure Mode World 1.png/revision/latest?cb=20150502143632 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/23/Maxwell Greeting Adventure Mode World 1.png/revision/latest?cb=20150502143632 



 

**“**Oh, You found my portal did you? You'd think you would have learned your lesson by now. Hmm. Let's try something a little more challenging, shall we?**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(NPC) "Maxwell (NPC)") greeting the player

A Cold Reception is similar to a Sandbox world, except the seasons change very quickly. A rainy 6 days of summer followed by a snowy 3 of winter makes exploration difficult. In addition, daytime will never exceed one third of the day, and significantly less during winter. Players are more vulnerable to insanity and freezing as they have to face near-constant rain or snow and much less daylight. Due to the seasons being so short, it's unlikely to see a [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops") in the first several winters.

There will always be at least one resource which is very rare. Sometimes the level generated will not have many [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling"), but a lot of [Spiky Bushes](/wiki/Spiky_Bush "Spiky Bush") instead; other times, [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass") might either be scarce or plentiful, but they're all pre-picked and need to be fertilized. This makes it difficult to survive winter with [Traps](/wiki/Traps "Traps"). Additionally, there might be no [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree"), only stumps. Food sources are limited; there are little to no [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bushes "Berry Bushes") and [Carrots](/wiki/Carrots "Carrots") can be rare. Furthermore, when farming Berry Bushes and other plants, there will be a far greater chance of an unfortunate lightning strike, due to the near-constant rain, so [Lightning Rods](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod") are a necessity.

All in all, this level should feel similar to a survival level, but with increased pressure on all of the player's resources. At least one [Thing](/wiki/Things "Things") will be on an island connected by a bridge that serves as a [Guardian Pig](/wiki/Guardian_Pig "Guardian Pig") checkpoint, which can make it quite tough to get through. However, this means that players will find a [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King") on the island. [Frog Rain](/wiki/Frog_Rain "Frog Rain") may be chronic due to the constant rain, however, players can use this to their advantage as they make an abundant food source, provided the player finds a way to deal with them.

**Tips:**

* If this is the first level, try to learn as many [Recipes](/wiki/Crafting "Crafting") as needed, because they are kept throughout the rest of the journey.
* It's important not to attack [Frogs](/wiki/Frogs "Frogs") when others are nearby, as all of them will gang up and attack the player. Try to kite the Frogs until they give up the chase.
* Alternatively, the player can trap the Frogs and they will be a consistent food source. Other Frogs in the area will not aggro because trapping them does not count as attacking.
* If this is not the first level, prepare a [Farm](/wiki/Farm "Farm") (in the previous level) to place, as the plentiful rain makes crops grow incredibly fast.
* Keep in mind that [Straw Rolls](/wiki/Straw_Roll "Straw Roll") and [Tents](/wiki/Tent "Tent") are very useful to skip the night and replenish [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") during this level. However, it is important to remember that sleeping restores sanity at the cost of [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") and is not highly recommended due to the scarcity of food sources.
* The following sources of food are found on this level: lots of [Rabbit Holes](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit"); [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird"), Frogs and Beefalos. Keep in mind that Tallbirds generally fight Frogs and if one does not die to Frogs, kiting and killing it is a good way to get [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat"), [Tallbird Eggs](/wiki/Tallbird_Egg "Tallbird Egg"), and [Frog Legs](/wiki/Frog_Legs "Frog Legs"). Keep in mind that killing most of these increase [Naughtiness](/wiki/Naughtiness "Naughtiness"), so be wary of [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus")!
* There are several areas that are blocked off by [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den"). Building 6 or more Traps and luring wave after wave of [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider") into it is a good way of cleaning them. Another way is to attempt to burn the Spider Dens down, but this is only recommended when the Spider Dens are in a [Forest](/wiki/Forest "Forest"), where the player would first light a tree on fire, or if they happen to come across the [Fire Staff Trap](/wiki/Set_Piece#Fire_Staff_Trap "Set Piece") where they can immediately light the dens on fire at a reasonably safe distance before making a run for it. One can also run in, plant a [Pine Cone](/wiki/Pine_Cone "Pine Cone") as close to the den as possible, then return when it is grown and light fire on it. If the player has just started and their area does not provide resources to make Traps, they can try and run through the Spider Dens at the cost of [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") and [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity").
* It's possible to travel to **Archipelago**, **The Game is Afoot**, or **King of Winter** (with the latter having infinite [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter")). Having [Rabbit Earmuffs](/wiki/Rabbit_Earmuff "Rabbit Earmuff"), a [Winter Hat](/wiki/Winter_Hat "Winter Hat"), or a [Beefalo Hat](/wiki/Beefalo_Hat "Beefalo Hat") will help greatly in those levels.
* The player should keep on their feet during the day and evening, stopping only to pick up food and the bare minimum for tools. Use every other night to set a [campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") by the trees so players may chop trees and cook carrots. Between those nights, keep moving by [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch"), using the reduced vision to gather [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs") and [Cut Grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass"), and to shave Beefalos. The player should make a base only if it's their first world and they need to prototype useful items, or if it is the 4th one and they want to prepare for the next world.
* An [Umbrella](/wiki/Umbrella "Umbrella") is highly recommended because [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") will drop very very quickly due to the near constant [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain").
* With rain comes lightning, so [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") will have trouble with sanity unless using an umbrella. Carry cooked Green or Blue Mushrooms, picked on dusk and night.
* Consider gathering [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") and using them to craft a [Garland](/wiki/Garland "Garland"). Picking Flowers will restore Sanity and Garland will help combat Sanity loss due to Rain and foregoing sleep for the first few days. If the player manages to get a [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") and x6 [Silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk") then they can craft a [Top Hat](/wiki/Top_Hat "Top Hat"), which restores 3.3 Sanity/min. Rain drains 3.3 Sanity/min., so it makes 0 Sanity loss.
* A quick and easy but rather risky way to get past blocked off areas such as the Pig Guardian checkpoint is to place 1 cut grass or 1 twig next to the wood wall and light it up with a torch.
* As the rain is frequent during summer, more combustible material is needed to maintain fire. Charcoal stacks up to 40 and will be in great supply when the large forests catch fire due to the of lightning strikes.
* When trying to find the Things, if the player is on an island-like landform, walk around all the edges of it with the divining rod as they have a good chance to pick up a signal without having to explore too much of the island. This does *NOT* work if the island is too large.

### King of Winter[]

:   **May appear on chapters 1 - 4**

**“**Well, would you look at that, you survived. One down, four to go!**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(NPC) "Maxwell (NPC)") greeting the player

Players are spawned in a [Grasslands](/wiki/Grasslands "Grasslands") [Biome](/wiki/Biome "Biome"). Maxwell informs them that an endless winter has already begun. Burning [trees](/wiki/Evergreen "Evergreen") surround the player to prevent from freezing, while they hear Maxwell's dialogue. Players can look forward to 1.5–3 minutes of daytime while juggling the ever-present effects of [freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing"), starvation, and [insanity](/wiki/Insanity "Insanity") in this harsh climate. On the other hand, nights do not last long in this world. It also introduces [Hound Mounds](/wiki/Hound_Mounds "Hound Mounds"), identified by animal [Bones](/wiki/Bones "Bones") on the ground. These are usually on a small area or island of their own, guarding a location on the map and forcing players to go through if they want to collect all the pieces. [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops") seems to spawn on day 7 to 9. If players ignore him and leave him somewhere, this will prevent him from respawning somewhere closer. However, his [eye](/wiki/Deerclops_Eyeball "Deerclops Eyeball") can help players gain [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") and [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") back, while also reducing their [sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") if they need to go through some Obelisks. This may not be worth the risk in the earlier days, unless the players brought a durable [Log Suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit") and [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet") combination to shield from damage.

The journey will be blocked by a group of [Boulders](/wiki/Boulders "Boulders") or [Obelisks](/wiki/Obelisks "Obelisks"). For the latter, players may need to have a certain level of sanity (either low or high level) in order to pass through the [Bridges](/wiki/Bridges "Bridges").

The world is permanently set to winter. The aim is to survive the cold without any preparation time. Players should not stay here for long; they should spend the first 2 to 3 days collecting resources and gathering plenty of food. Then they must explore as quick as possible to find the rest of the pieces.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/60/Strange Obelish.png/revision/latest?cb=20130317071643 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/60/Strange Obelish.png/revision/latest?cb=20130317071643 



 

This is one of the more difficult levels to start in because players initially have no way of keeping warm except for the Heat Stone, which isn't very effective. It's not a bad idea to stay here a little bit longer to prepare for the levels ahead. Getting the [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter") is very helpful to raise sanity back up when players have to go insane to get through the Obelisks.

Near the start location will be a dead adventurer with a backpack containing a [Blueprint](/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") for one random invention, a [Heat Stone](/wiki/Heat_Stone "Heat Stone"), some [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log"), [Cut Grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass"), [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs"), and a [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch"). Sometimes the backpack may also contain a [Red Gem](/wiki/Red_Gem "Red Gem") and several [Nightmare Fuels](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel"). Also, lying nearby is a blueprint for [Rabbit Earmuffs](/wiki/Rabbit_Earmuffs "Rabbit Earmuffs"), a [Divining Rod](/wiki/Divining_Rod "Divining Rod"), [Logs](/wiki/Logs "Logs"), and an [Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe").

**General Tips:**

This is a very difficult level and it might take more than 3 tries to pass this. It depends on the number of obelisks in the level, also the type and amount of natural resources available (e.g. [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbits "Rabbits") may not be present at all, or limited [grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass") in a sector).

* Because Obelisks will block passages, it's important to know how to pass through them. There are 2 types of Obelisks. One requires the player to have high Sanity, another requires low Sanity. The player will need 15% maximum sanity (30 for most characters) or lower to pass through the low one.
  + Reduce Sanity by collecting (-5), eating (-5) or standing nearby (-25/min) [Evil Flowers](/wiki/Evil_Flowers "Evil Flowers")/[Dark Petals](/wiki/Dark_Petal "Dark Petal"), eating [Raw Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") (-10), eating [Cooked Monster Meat](/wiki/Cooked_Monster_Meat "Cooked Monster Meat") (-10), digging up [graves](/wiki/Graves "Graves") (-10), eating raw [Green Cap](/wiki/Green_Cap "Green Cap") (-50), and more. Refer to [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") list.
  + Restore [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") by picking up [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") (+5), and eating [Cooked Green Cap](/wiki/Cooked_Green_Cap "Cooked Green Cap") (+15) at the price of -1 [Health](/wiki/Health "Health"). If one has enough [Monster Meats](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat")/[Meats](/wiki/Meat "Meat"), befriending a [Pig](/wiki/Pig "Pig") will help increase sanity (+25/min).
  + Accumulation of [Green Mushrooms](/wiki/Green_Mushroom "Green Mushroom") is highly suggested before crossing low sanity Obelisks so that one can cook to quickly restore sanity.
* Timing is important when moving between 'sectors' that are split off by low level sanity Obelisks. The player should gather enough resources in case the new sector is lacking a particular resource (e.g. Boulders) and if one is unable to return to the previous location; as being insane can make it more difficult with [Crawling Horror](/wiki/Shadow_Creature#Crawling_Horror "Shadow Creature") threats.
* If the player happens to start in or find a 'rich' resource area, they might want to consider staying in the area for a while to gather all its resources before moving to the next sector.
* It's best to stand near a fire source until the Heat Stone is charged to max. When it is charged to max, it will turn orange in color. This will give the player more time to explore before building a fire.
* If the player has problems finding Boulders, remember that those can be found in small numbers in the [Forests](/wiki/Forest "Forest"). Also, [Gold Nuggets](/wiki/Gold_Nugget "Gold Nugget") can be scattered around [Graveyards](/wiki/Graveyard "Graveyard") or near big amounts of [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Dens "Spider Dens").
* If the player reaches a choke point with [Hound Mounds](/wiki/Hound_Mounds "Hound Mounds") scattered around, two of the ways to get through them is by using a Beefalo Horn to lure beefalo and distract the hounds while the player destroys the mounds or flat out running, avoiding the hound's attacks until the player reaches a place where the hounds stop following (it is useful to wear a [Feather Hat](/wiki/Feather_Hat "Feather Hat"), as this will attract birds which will take the hounds interest for a short time).
* Hounds from Hound Mounds, [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird"), and even [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops") can also be taken out with use of [Tooth Traps](/wiki/Tooth_Traps "Tooth Traps") and the kiting method.
* Obtaining the [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter") can be tricky due to the long range of [MacTusk's](/wiki/MacTusk "MacTusk") darts and the fast speed of his [hounds](/wiki/Blue_Hound "Blue Hound"). The best approach to the group is to lure the hounds away and deal with them separately from MacTusk and his son, analyze if any healing is necessary, then going back to fight MacTusk. The player may need to try several times, as the hat has merely a 25% drop rate. It is the best hat in the game to wear for regaining sanity and also helps with warmth, making it a worthy endeavour.

**​Food/Resource Tips:**

* [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush"), Grass and other renewable resources no longer respawn. Plan accordingly when using up an area's resources.
* If Grass is scarce, try to pick up as many as possible and use sparingly. Since the level has only winter, [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log") and Grass are needed all the time to make [Campfires](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire"). An alternative way to quickly get warm is to use a [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch") to burn stray trees (so it won't spread) and [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure") (if available). Manure can be collected and used to fuel camp fires. A great approach, if rocks are in good supply, is to build [Fire Pits](/wiki/Fire_Pit "Fire Pit"). These require no grass to build and are permanent.
* If there are Rabbits try to catch them with a [Trap](/wiki/Trap "Trap"). Use [Carrots](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot") to bait, or (preferred) 'guide' it towards the trap by placing it near the rabbit's home entrance so that it runs into the trap. 2 Rabbits and 1 twig are needed for Rabbit Earmuffs.
* If there are no Rabbits on the map, hunting for [Koalefants](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant") will provide 8 [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") which is more *cost effective* than hunting for Beefalo. However, Koalefants are also time consuming to locate and they hit a bit harder than Beefalo. It is advisable to have [Armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor") and a [Ranged Weapon](/wiki/Category:Ranged_Weapons "Category:Ranged Weapons") when hunting.
* Try to make a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") as soon as possible as it is more effective to fulfill hunger and sanity.
* Remember to collect Monster Meat since it can be used to make Pigs follow. They can be a great help fighting against [MacTusks](/wiki/MacTusk "MacTusk") and other aggressive animals. Beware, feeding them 4 Monster Meats in total turns them into [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepigs "Werepigs"). It is also helpful to use Monster Meat in Crock Pot recipes.

### The Game is Afoot[]

:   **May appear on chapters 1 - 4**

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/c8/Maxwell Greeting Adventure Mode 3.png/revision/latest?cb=20150502155337 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/c8/Maxwell Greeting Adventure Mode 3.png/revision/latest?cb=20150502155337 



 

**“**What? You're still here? Impressive, but you should probably stop while you're ahead.**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(NPC) "Maxwell (NPC)") greeting the player

Players are spawned on the ground of a [Marsh](/wiki/Marsh "Marsh") surrounded by normal [Grassland](/wiki/Grassland "Grassland"). The player will spawn near a chest usually containing 7 [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log"), a [Winter Hat](/wiki/Winter_Hat "Winter Hat"), and 3 [Flint](/wiki/Flint "Flint"). On a rare occasion, this chest may contain 10 [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot") and 4 random [Blueprints](/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint"). Sometimes the Chest is spawned near a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") and can be ignited immediately, costing the player whatever items were inside. Seasonal cycles are not present in this world. The world begins in winter, and will turn to endless summer ([Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring") in *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")*) after 10 days. Periodic [Hound Attacks](/wiki/Hound "Hound") begin in this world.

The world features a resource-rich central island surrounded by dangerous lands containing the [Teleportato](/wiki/Teleportato "Teleportato") [Things](/wiki/Things "Things"). There is the possibility of an island being completely cut off from the rest of the world, requiring players to find a [Wormhole](/wiki/Wormhole "Wormhole") to get to it. The central island will always have [Grassland](/wiki/Grasslands "Grasslands"), [Forest](/wiki/Forest "Forest"), and [Savanna](/wiki/Savanna "Savanna"), but no other biomes except the tiny marsh at the spawning point. Outlying areas may have any biome.

**Tips:**

Players will see various mobs and mob housing occupying the bridges connecting the central landmass to the outlying areas and sometimes on bridges chaining together two outlying areas. It's also possible for a bridge to exist entirely within the central landmass connecting already contiguous land; in this case it can simply be avoided.

Players are advised to move quickly and be well equipped when crossing these blockades.

As [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider") will be present in the central area, it is possible to stock up on [Healing Salves](/wiki/Healing_Salve "Healing Salve") before venturing out.

A [Grass Suit](/wiki/Grass_Suit "Grass Suit") or [Log Suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit") will provide protection without the reduced movement of a [Marble Suit](/wiki/Marble_Suit "Marble Suit") which can be deadly when running a blockade. It will also be possible to craft a [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet") from [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") (the [Crank Thing](/wiki/Crank_Thing "Crank Thing") will always spawn one and there will usually be a pig village in an outlying area) or from [Pig Heads](/wiki/Pig_Head "Pig Head") near [Touch Stones](/wiki/Touch_Stone "Touch Stone") or [Merm Houses](/wiki/Merm_House "Merm House").

Blockades on the bridges and the ways to deal with them:

* Keep in mind that not everything needs to be killed if it can be avoided by the player.
* Tier 3 [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") - The [Sticky Webbing](/wiki/Spider_Den#Sticky_Webbing "Spider Den") around the dens will usually completely cover the ground, making it impossible to cross without provoking the spiders. The player can usually run past the [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") anyway, at cost of [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") as spiders attack. Equipping a [Spiderhat](/wiki/Spiderhat "Spiderhat") and/or a [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane") can make this run safer. (For tips on clearing out the dens instead, see the [Spider Den](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") page.) If left alone, the tier 3 dens will spawn [Spider Queens](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen") and consequently more dens, making the crossing more dangerous as time progresses.
* [Hound Mounds](/wiki/Hound_Mound "Hound Mound") - Avoidance is key here; this blockade can be run through because generally [Hounds](/wiki/Hound "Hound") are not fast enough to catch a player who keeps moving. This is safer during [Day](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle") when hounds are usually not roaming away from their mounds.
* [Tallbird Nests](/wiki/Tallbird_Nest "Tallbird Nest") - This blockade can be run through during [Dusk](/wiki/Dusk "Dusk") or [Night](/wiki/Night "Night") because during this time the [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird") sleep. This blockade will also have [Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder"), including gold vein boulders, make it a valuable source of food and resources.
* [Killer Bee Hives](/wiki/Killer_Bee_Hive "Killer Bee Hive") - A run through this blockade will almost always cost the player [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") as not all attacks can be avoided. A player cornered by multiple [Killer Bee](/wiki/Bee "Bee") swarms can easily be stun-locked and severely injured or killed; some cautious feints to avoid dead ends are advised. In addition to other armor, a [Beekeeper Hat](/wiki/Beekeeper_Hat "Beekeeper Hat") will reduce 80% of incoming damage from bees, useful either for running or for clearing the blockade. (For tips on clearing out some or all of the hives, see the [Beehive](/wiki/Beehive "Beehive") page.)
* [Clockwork Monsters](/wiki/Category:Clockwork_Monsters "Category:Clockwork Monsters") - A run through this blockade will almost always cost the player [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") as [Clockwork Bishop](/wiki/Clockwork_Bishop "Clockwork Bishop") attacks are difficult to avoid. It is possible to clear this blockade with mob-on-mob violence: use a [Beefalo Horn](/wiki/Beefalo_Horn "Beefalo Horn") or a [Spiderhat](/wiki/Spiderhat "Spiderhat") to lead a mob into the blockade or position the [Clockwork Rook](/wiki/Clockwork_Rook "Clockwork Rook") to charge into the other clockwork monsters.
* [Swamp](/wiki/Swamp "Swamp") Spiral - This spiral bridge is heavily infested with [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle") leaving no safe place to stand. However, the tentacles do not anticipate the player's movements so it is possible to simply run around the spiral faster than the tentacles react, taking no damage except to [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"). Stopping or reversing direction on the bridge is not advised, so watch for dead ends at the edges of the spiral.

Wickerbottom in Archipelago, by some tier 3 Spider Dens and a Worm Hole.

 

**“**Say, pal. You're really pushing your luck. Turn back now, or I may have to resort to drastic measures.**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(NPC) "Maxwell (NPC)") greeting the player

Players are spawned on one of six islands. The only way to get to other islands is by [Worm Holes](/wiki/Worm_Hole "Worm Hole"). There is one [Thing](/wiki/Thing "Thing") on each island except on the beginning island. One island may contain one or more worm holes that split off to multiple islands. It's likely that the player may need to return to the previous island(s) after collecting one piece of the Thing, in order to set up the Teleportato at the [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing").

The season begins at the start of spring and will gradually change over time similar to sandbox mode. Each island is dominated by mostly one or two biomes. The islands are placed in a circular shape, and while the shape is no indication of the order the wormholes will travel in, each island always has the same two [biomes](/wiki/Biome "Biome") each time the player tries Archipelago.

The starting island has a small square shaped biome full of [Carrots](/wiki/Carrots "Carrots"), [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), [Saplings](/wiki/Saplings "Saplings"), and [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bushes "Berry Bushes"), with the rest of the island dominated by a massive [Swamp](/wiki/Swamp "Swamp") filled with [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den"), [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle"), and [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm").

**Tips:**

* It's suggested that in the first [Forest](/wiki/Forest "Forest") biome encountered, the player should collect enough [Logs](/wiki/Logs "Logs"), [Cut Grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass"), [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs"), and [Flint](/wiki/Flint "Flint") to survive for a long while, because they won't be seeing some of the resources in the forest biome again.
* It is recommended that players establish a way to come back from or cope with [insanity](/wiki/Insanity "Insanity"), since it's inevitable that they will be traveling via wormholes quite often.
* Usually, two of the six islands are Swamps. It can be very useful to stick around when Merms and [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider") are fighting Tentacles, as this gives free items. Dead Tentacles provide a weapon. Dead Merms provide [Fish](/wiki/Fish "Fish") and [Frog Legs](/wiki/Frog_Legs "Frog Legs"), which can be used to make [Fish Sticks](/wiki/Fish_Sticks "Fish Sticks") or [Meatballs](/wiki/Meatballs "Meatballs"). Dead Spiders provide [Silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk") and [Spider Glands](/wiki/Spider_Gland "Spider Gland"). The player just has to be cautious not to die themselves while attempting to collect the loot.
* Spend the first day grabbing everything in the starting biome, especially food and flowers. Food is scarce on the other five islands, and there is a high insanity risk too.
* Each island may have a particular set of creatures according to the biomes.
  + Starting and 2nd island: Swamp Biome has Merms, Spiders, [Mosquitoes](/wiki/Mosquitoes "Mosquitoes"), and Tentacles.
  + 1 island: [Grassland](/wiki/Grassland "Grassland")/Forest Biome has [Killer Bee Hives](/wiki/Killer_Bee_Hive "Killer Bee Hive"), [Bees](/wiki/Bees "Bees"), and Spiders.
  + 1 island: [Rockyland](/wiki/Rockyland "Rockyland") Biome has [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird").
  + 1 island: Rockyland/Forest Biome has Spiders and [Hound Mounds](/wiki/Hound_Mound "Hound Mound").
  + 1 island: [Savanna](/wiki/Savanna "Savanna") Biome has [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo"), Spiders and usually the usual creatures near the Wooden Thing.
* When using the wormhole, it's possible that the player will travel into the middle of a field of Killer Bee Hives, Spiders, or aggressive creatures. So be prepared to run towards safety.
* the player can destroy the hives/mounds with ranged weapons and fires, especially [fire darts](/wiki/Fire_Dart "Fire Dart") due to the abundance of trees ([Charcoal](/wiki/Charcoal "Charcoal")) and Swamps ([Reeds](/wiki/Reeds "Reeds")). (**Not Advised** as it's time and resource consuming; the objective is to locate the Things)
* If possible, bringing a [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane") from the previous level is helpful to kite aggressive creatures, pass through swamps with tentacles, and locate all five Things.
* If this is the fourth level, be prepared for the final stage **Darkness** as it's quite difficult.

### Two Worlds[]

:   **May appear on chapters 3 - 4**

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/4a/Maxwell Greeting Adventure Mode Two Worlds.png/revision/latest?cb=20150502160229 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/4a/Maxwell Greeting Adventure Mode Two Worlds.png/revision/latest?cb=20150502160229 



 

**“**Say. pal. Let's make a deal. You can stay here. Settle down, even. I'll give you food, gold, pigs, whatever you need. All I want in return is a truce.**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(NPC) "Maxwell (NPC)") greeting the player

The character awakens on ground made of [Cobblestones](/wiki/Cobblestones "Cobblestones") surrounded by a [Fire Pit](/wiki/Fire_Pit "Fire Pit"), a [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent"), [Trees](/wiki/Trees "Trees"), [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bushes "Berry Bushes"), and [Carrots](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot"). Maxwell materializes to ask the player for a truce, provided they stay there. Seven out of eight minutes are daylight on the large mainland where the player starts. In addition, there are no [Things](/wiki/Things "Things") on this land.

In order to locate the Things the player must travel through [Worm Holes](/wiki/Worm_Hole "Worm Hole") that connect the mainland to the secondary land. There are two types of [Worm Holes](/wiki/Worm_Hole "Worm Hole"). One is the normal Wormhole encountered in sandbox mode, and the other is the [Sick Worm Hole](/wiki/Sick_Worm_Hole#Sick_Worm_Holes "Sick Worm Hole") that can only be used for a one way trip.

When on the secondary island, certain parts of the [biomes](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes") will cause the day/night cycle to turn from 7 out of 8 minutes day to a more normal cycle, about 3–4 minutes daylight out of 8 (E.g. Walking/traveling through worm hole from a [grassland](/wiki/Grassland "Grassland") to a [swamp](/wiki/Swamp "Swamp") biome will cause the time shift). Care should be taken of the time travelling between biomes as the time change may make it dark faster than expected.

**Tips:**

* The mainland should have plenty of food and since daylight is much longer, respawn rates from berry bushes and other plants are faster.
* The secondary island has a wide range of aggressive creatures. Take caution.
* If this world appeared on chapter 3, it's recommended that the player brings winter gear with them to the next world, as it is possible for **The Game is Afoot** or **King of Winter** to appear in chapter 4 if they haven't appeared before.
* If this world appeared on chapter 4, it is recommended that the player brings a stack of fireflies (for a [Miner Hat](/wiki/Miner_Hat "Miner Hat")) and lots of food ([Jerky](/wiki/Jerky "Jerky") or [Honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey") because of their high spoilage time), as the next world will be in permanent night and scarce on food. Use this chapter as a chance to *prepare* for the challenging level **Darkness**.

---

### Darkness[]

:   **Always appears on chapter 5**

**“**You insolent, pitiful, insignificant ant! Do not arouse the wrath of the great Maxwell! You will regret coming any further...**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(NPC) "Maxwell (NPC)") greeting the player

Chapter 5 has several modifiers making it the end of the journey for all but the most well-prepared players. The player spawns with a bunch of [Campfires](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") and Fire Pits surrounding them. Also, there will be a [backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") nearby which has [Blueprints](/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") for the [Miner Hat](/wiki/Miner_Hat "Miner Hat"), a healthy stack of [grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), a stack of [logs](/wiki/Logs "Logs"), two random items, and an extra random [blueprint](/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint"). The level's Day-night cycle has only permanent night, thus players have to survive and find the [Things](/wiki/Things "Things") in complete darkness. Since there is no daylight, most creatures are asleep, crops won't grow and other plants may take longer to replenish themselves, and most importantly, sanity continuously declines over time. To make things worse, due to chronic low sanity, building life-saving camp fires will often attract [Night Hands](/wiki/Shadow_Creature#Night_Hand "Shadow Creature") that will attempt to put out the light (they also decrease sanity when near the player).

There are almost no food resources and the only source of natural light is [Maxwell's Lights](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Light "Maxwell's Light") scattered around the map. They will not help the player much if they did not come prepared enough. The map is a linear progression where each [Biome](/wiki/Biome "Biome") is connected by a [bridge](/wiki/Bridges "Bridges") (slightly similar to the ones in "King of Winter") that might be blocked by [Boulders](/wiki/Boulders "Boulders"). Players should have a [Pickaxe](/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe") or [gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder") ready to blow through them. There is a chance that the bridge might be blocked by [Obelisks](/wiki/Obelisk "Obelisk"). Each area has a Thing so they should be found before moving onto the next Biome.

There are [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") sleeping on the map which can be killed for meat, however with their kiting A.I. they can be a bit tricky. There is a chance to find [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird") in this map which are in the player's best interest to kill, especially if they have laid an [egg](/wiki/Tallbird_Egg "Tallbird Egg"). [Koalefant](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant") is also quite worth it. There are Maxwell Lights positioned around the map that turn on when the player is near; they can be used as an opportunity to take out the Divining Rod to find the Things. Cooking [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms") along the way can prevent extreme sanity loss e.g. [Cooked Blue or Green Caps](/wiki/Cooked_Blue_Cap "Cooked Blue Cap"). The dual uses of the [Blue Mushroom](/wiki/Blue_Mushroom "Blue Mushroom"), which can be eaten raw to replenish hunger and health at the expense of sanity, can be a life saver in certain situations.

**Tips**:

* In order to build a Miner Hat, it's HIGHLY recommended that the player unlocks the [Bug Net](/wiki/Bug_Net "Bug Net") from the previous level so they can catch [Fireflies](/wiki/Fireflies "Fireflies"). This will save grass and twigs from making torches. Bringing a stack of [Gold](/wiki/Gold "Gold") from the previous level is helpful. The greater light radius provided by the Miner Hat can be critical to survival when traveling through [Tooth Trap](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Tooth_Trap "Maxwell's Tooth Trap") fields and [Hound Mound](/wiki/Hound_Mound "Hound Mound") areas.
* Only build camp fires to cook food, but hurry as Night Hands would put out. It's not advised to stop them, as they will continuously attack the fire (due to permanent darkness) and also decrease sanity (just put on the [Miner's Hat](/wiki/Miner_Hat "Miner Hat") and walk towards them constantly until they vanish).
* The player may need to build a Log Suit while traveling through the [Swamp](/wiki/Swamp "Swamp") Biomes as the darkness makes it difficult to navigate and avoid [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacles "Tentacles"). This means sacrificing the backpack.
* If the player has not found any of these food sources and they are getting desperate for food, they must resort to [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders"). [Cooked Monster Meat](/wiki/Cooked_Monster_Meat "Cooked Monster Meat") can be a life saver at the expense of sanity.
* Suggested items to bring over from previous level:
  + A stack of gold to facilitate making the [Miner's Hats](/wiki/Miner_Hat "Miner Hat").
  + A [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane") to kite and travel faster.
  + A stack of [Jerky](/wiki/Jerky "Jerky") or other long-lasting food supply that also restores health or sanity.
  + Spider [Silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk") for catching Fireflies with Bug Nets and [Top Hats](/wiki/Top_Hat "Top Hat") or a [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter") (highly recommended) to use when standing near stationary light sources; or pre-captured stack of Fireflies for Miner Hats.

### Epilogue: Checkmate[]

:   **Appears after all the other chapters.**

**“**Is this how it ends?**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(NPC) "Maxwell (NPC)") meeting the player

This is the last level of Adventure Mode. The player has reached Maxwell's location.

Epilogue is a dark and dead wasteland, with a hallway in the center leading to the [Nightmare Throne](/wiki/Nightmare_Throne "Nightmare Throne"). The hallway branches off into small areas containing resources. The first area contains 4 [chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests") filled with supplies, the second area has some [grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass") and [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush") (most are barren), the third area has 3 [crafting stations](/wiki/Category:Crafting_Stations "Category:Crafting Stations") used for prototyping, and the last area has 3 [Crock Pots](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") and some mixed food lying on the ground next to them.

Similar to the last level, this level has permanent night, with [Maxwell's Lights](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Light "Maxwell's Light") being the only light source. Regardless of sanity, eyes can be seen in the darkness. Out in the wastelands is a fully assembled [Teleportato](/wiki/Teleportato "Teleportato") that teleports the player to the Nightmare Throne.

The map will always be covered by the fog of war, even after an area has been explored, thus rendering the map completely useless.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/6f/Nightmare Throne ingame.png/revision/latest?cb=20140123200732 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/6f/Nightmare Throne ingame.png/revision/latest?cb=20140123200732 

Maxwell on the Nightmare Throne.

 

At the end of the road, players will reach Maxwell's Hall. A deformed Maxwell is sitting in a large chair with a [phonograph](/wiki/Phonograph "Phonograph") nearby playing music, if the player turns it off, Maxwell will thank them. When meeting Maxwell, he will tell the player that when he got here there was nothing but dust and "them" and that he doesn't know what they want, that they are just watching. If the player attacks Maxwell, the throne protects him (a lightning bolt will strike the player and no matter what weapon they are holding, it will vanish). Maxwell tells the player that the throne will not allow it. He also tells them that he has been around here for a long time, and that the player can stay around and keep him company, or to put the key in the box.

Next to the throne is the Nightmare Lock where the [Divining Rod](/wiki/Divining_Rod "Divining Rod") can be placed. If the Divining Rod is put in the lock, the game will ask the player if they want to take pity on Maxwell but that his captors would not be happy about it. When Maxwell is freed from the throne, he gets up and instantly dies, then turns to dust and fades away. The character is grabbed by Shadow Hands and is placed on the throne, effectively taking Maxwell's place and becoming the new pawn (and turning the phonograph on again, if the player had turned it off before). After that, the player will get the final message from Klei, and then be brought back to the sandbox game as [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell/Character "Maxwell/Character"). The player at this point has beaten Adventure Mode and unlocked Maxwell as a playable character.

**Note**: If the player beats Adventure World as Maxwell, the latest character they used to complete the game will be sitting in the chair, still doing the terrified animation. Unlocking the lock will kill them, and put Maxwell back in the chair. The player will wake up in the world as that character.

**Note**: There will still be periodic Hound Attacks in this level.

**Easter Egg**: Far behind (in the left side) the Nightmare throne is a graveyard, with an Eyebone and a Miner Hat next to a skeleton. On the graves are the names of the developers of the game, one example being Kevin Forbes. Caution is advised if the graves are dug up, as ghosts have a 100% chance to spawn from them.

**Easter Egg**: Randomly placed somewhere on the map, there is an island made of 2-3 tiles, on which there is a Teleportato as well as the 4 pieces. This island cannot be reached or "mapped" without the use of cheats, and when this Teleportato is used, it teleports the player back to the nightmare throne where a second deformed Maxwell will spawn (not on the throne) and say "Don't you think I've tried that?" then disappear.

**Easter Egg**: If the player uses the console to reveal the minimap fog, an island will be visible that is completely barren save for the underlying grass turf.

---

## Exiting Adventure Mode[]

If the player dies in Adventure Mode, they will wake up in Sandbox Mode in the same state as they left it.

If the player beats Adventure Mode, they will wake up in Sandbox Mode in the same state as they left it, with one exception: they will now be the character who was rescued from the Nightmare Throne. The player may continue their Sandbox survival with this new character or choose to open Maxwell's Door again and attempt to rescue their original character.

When returning to the Sandbox by death or victory, the player will have all of the items previously held in the Sandbox and know all of the recipes previously learned in the Sandbox by the character who entered Adventure Mode. The items in the player's Adventure Mode inventory are lost and the recipes learned during Adventure Mode are forgotten. The player can immediately enter Adventure Mode again if they wish.

| Possible Levels Found In Adventure Mode[] | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | A Cold Reception | King of Winter | The Game Is Afoot | Archipelago | Two Worlds | Darkness |

| Chapter 4 | no | **yes** | **yes** | **yes** | **yes** | no |

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Caves will not spawn in this mode.
* In adventure mode, if you put [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff") on the [Nightmare Throne](/wiki/Nightmare_Throne "Nightmare Throne"), and then return to him for another character, it seems that [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff") has escaped.

## Mosquito Bugs[]

* Chapters can sometimes be skipped by rapidly clicking the "Lets go" button. Additionally, chapters will sometimes load as the previous chapter's ending, allowing the player to reload the teleportato and go immediately to the chapter after that.

 File:Don%27t Starve Adventure Mode Glitch Exploit 

* In Chapter 5, "Darkness", if the game is saved and reloaded during a full moon, the full moon will be permanent. However, a full moon no longer provides illumination in this chapter.
* Sometimes, in the "The Game is Afoot" or "Archipelago" level, there is no [Metal Potato Thing](/wiki/Metal_Potato_Thing "Metal Potato Thing").
* If [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") appear when the player takes pity on Maxwell they can still attack the character in the cutscene, which means if the player dies, they will be sent back without actually freeing the other character.
* Sometimes, islands on "Archipelago" will spawn fused to each other, putting two things on one large island.
* If Lucy is destroyed via attacking Maxwell, Woodie will sit backwards on the throne.
* While the animation that plays when the player enters adventure mode, time still runs, making it possible for the player to lose hunger, sanity or make it night on the world.
