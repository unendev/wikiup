## Official Description[]

*Charlie’s machinations have come to a head as she turns her attention towards the skies - and the mysterious entity that awaits there. Our Survivors will be forced to contend with terrifying monstrosities beyond their comprehension, and yet, there may be a silver lining: their minds and horizons will be expanded under the sublime light of an ancient moon.*

### Turn of Tides[]

*Something ancient stirs in the night sky, and the world below will never be the same. A strange new island teeming with life has appeared, and with it, a whole new slew of challenges for our Survivors to face.*

*Keep a wary eye out. They’re almost here.*

### Salty Dog[]

*Welcome to the brine shoals. Filled with the new salt rock resource, survivors looking to stretch the life of their food with this new spice will need to brave the dreaded Cookie Cutters. And watch out for the Malbatross. Getting on it's bad side will be a weight around anyone's neck.*

*Facing these new dangers and coming home with the goods will make you a real salty dog!*

### Hook, Line and Inker[]

*A nice day of fishing sounded like just the thing to soothe the nerves of our weary Survivors, but it looks like fish aren’t the only things that are biting. Luckily there’s something to distract them from their soggy seafaring sorrows - the return of Winter’s Feast! And this year it seems that the Constant has provided its own assortment of holiday gifts… could it be that a certain someone is feeling particularly jolly this year?*

### She Sells Sea Shells[]

*Far out past the familiar shores of the mainland, something is waiting for our Survivors. What would you do for the thing you treasure most?*

### Troubled Waters[]

*The seas seem to grow more dangerous with every passing day. Is this the work of Charlie, or is the strange, mutating influence of the moon growing stronger? Let’s hope our Survivors can stay afloat long enough to find out.*

### Forgotten Knowledge[]

*It seems that the chunk of moon that crashed into the ocean did more than create a new island, but broke through to the caves below as well, revealing previously sealed passageways that had sat undiscovered by our Survivors. What ancient secrets might be kept within?*

### Reap What You Sow[]

*The days have been filled with tilling and toil,*

*Gathering seeds and nourishing soil,*

*In hopes that the crops will produce at their best,*

*(Just make sure that you keep a sharp eye out for pests!)*

### Eye of the Storm[]

*With the three lunar altars now complete, the truth at the center of this ancient mystery will finally come to light...*

*They've been here all along.*

*Don't Starve Together: Return of Them - Eye of the Storm is now available for all players. With this conclusion of the Return of them Story Arc, worlds collide as old threats and familiar faces make themselves known.*

*As this chapter comes to an end, we are left to wonder to what end will Charlie's machinations bring our survivors. And what does she still have planned?*

### Tweaks/Changes to existing content[]

* [The Moon](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle") has a crack in it.
* The [Potter's Wheel](/wiki/Potter%27s_Wheel "Potter's Wheel") now also accepts Moon Shards as sculpting blocks, allowing all [Sculptures](/wiki/Chess_Pieces "Chess Pieces") to be made with this material.
* [Down Feathers](/wiki/Down_Feather "Down Feather") can now be burned in the fire as fuel, alongside Malbatross Feathers.
* [Fish](/wiki/Fish "Fish") were changed to freshwater fish and are caught alive. They can no longer be stacked as each has an individual weight. [Eels](/wiki/Eel "Eel") are also caught alive and cannot be stacked for the same reason. They now spoil into Spoiled Fish Morsel and Spoiled Fish respectively instead of becoming Rot.
* The [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") now differentiates different fish values: freshwater fish and small ocean fish are worth 0.5 fish, while eels and medium ocean fish are worth 1 fish. As a result, crock pot recipes that require fish were tweaked accordingly: [Fishsticks](/wiki/Fishsticks "Fishsticks"), [Fish Tacos](/wiki/Fish_Tacos "Fish Tacos") and [Moqueca](/wiki/Moqueca "Moqueca") require 0.5 fish, [Fish Cordon Bleu](/wiki/Fish_Cordon_Bleu "Fish Cordon Bleu") requires 1 fish and [Ceviche](/wiki/Ceviche "Ceviche") requires 2 fish.
* [Leafy Meat](/wiki/Leafy_Meat "Leafy Meat") can now be used in the Crock Pot.
* Some Crock Pot dishes require less [meat](/wiki/Meats "Meats") values now.
* [Suspicious Dirt Piles](/wiki/Suspicious_Dirt_Pile "Suspicious Dirt Pile") have a chance to find a [Volt Goat](/wiki/Volt_Goat "Volt Goat").
* Removed [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom")'s [Applied Horticulture](/wiki/Books#Applied_Horticulture "Books") and replaced it with [Applied Silviculture](/wiki/Books#Applied_Silviculture "Books") and [Horticulture, Abridged](/wiki/Books#Horticulture,_Abridged "Books").
* [Bunnyman](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") loot is reduced from 2 [Carrot](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot"), 75% [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") and 25% [Bunny Puff](/wiki/Bunny_Puff "Bunny Puff") to 37.5% Carrot, 37.5% Meat and 25% Bunny Puff.
* The [Disease](/wiki/Disease "Disease") mechanic is completely removed.
* The [Birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage") no longer accepts [Cooked Eggs](/wiki/Egg#Cooked_Egg "Egg"), but now accepts raw [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat"). Feeding a [Vegetable](/wiki/Vegetable "Vegetable") gives only one plant seed.
* [Bees](/wiki/Bee "Bee") are no longer hostile to [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") unless provoked.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The official Chinese translation of *Return of Them* is *旧神归来*, which means "return of the Elder God(s)." This could imply that They are a reference to the Elder Gods from the Cthulhu Mythos.[[26]](#cite_note-26)
* In *Rhymes With Play* # 278, they revealed concept art of an unused mob design. This creature could move in water and on land, but it would spawn only in the sea. It would require being fed, and would float away if you hit it.
* The first update, *Turn of Tides* was originally intended to be released on June 20, 2019.[[27]](#cite_note-27)
* DST developers have repeatedly stated in various places that the *Reap What You Sow* update is not a *Return of Them* update, (despite using the *Return of Them* bug tracker and forums)[[28]](#cite_note-28)[[29]](#cite_note-29) but it was later included under *Return of Them* upon its release.
