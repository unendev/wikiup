### [Code](/wiki/Console "Console")

`"woodlegs"`

Woodlegs spawns with 1/4th of the closest [X Marks the Spots](/wiki/X_Marks_the_Spot "X Marks the Spot") revealed on the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map"), a [Lucky Hat](/wiki/Lucky_Hat "Lucky Hat"), [Spyglass](/wiki/Spyglass "Spyglass"), a [Boat Cannon](/wiki/Boat_Cannon "Boat Cannon"), 4 [Boards](/wiki/Boards "Boards") and 4 [Dubloons](/wiki/Dubloons "Dubloons"). The last three let him create a special [Boat](/wiki/Boats "Boats") only he can make - [The 'Sea Legs'](/wiki/The_%27Sea_Legs%27 "The 'Sea Legs'"). The 'Sea Legs' has the same durability and speed as an [Armoured Boat](/wiki/Armoured_Boat "Armoured Boat"), and an infinite Boat Cannon that deals 50 damage.

Woodlegs sailing on The 'Sea Legs'.

 

His Lucky Hat lets Woodlegs 'sniff out' treasures. That means that as long as it is equipped, new [X Marks the Spot](/wiki/X_Marks_the_Spot "X Marks the Spot") treasures (maximum of 6 per hat) will spawn in the current or nearby islands. That makes the treasures renewable when playing as him. The Hat lasts 10 [Days](/wiki/Day "Day") and can be made in the [Nautical Tab](/wiki/Nautical_Tab "Nautical Tab") with 3 [Cloth](/wiki/Cloth "Cloth"), 4 [Bone Shard](/wiki/Bone_Shards "Bone Shards") and 10 [Dubloons](/wiki/Dubloons "Dubloons"). Both the Lucky Hat and The 'Sea Legs' can be created from the start without any Research Stations.

## Disadvantage[]

Woodlegs loses 4.8 Sanity per minute when on land, and also when hugging the coast with a Boat. This coupled with the 120 maximum Sanity makes it very easy to go insane in the early days.

The 'Sea Legs' has no equippable slots and its acceleration is 50% slower. In addition to this, it has a stun immunity of only 1 second compared to the Armoured Boat's 2, but still higher than other Boats.

Woodlegs is designed specifically for Shipwrecked, therefore, playing as him on any other DLC will be challenging.

## Prototype Tips[]

* In the early days, the easiest way to restore the Sanity lost from land exploration is to collect [Flowers](/wiki/Flowers "Flowers") and [Seashells](/wiki/Seashells "Seashells") while exploring.
* It is possible to find a Walking Cane or Thulecite Club in X Marks the Spot [Chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest") early on, making the speed of The 'Sea Legs' more bearable without sails.
* The [Coconade](/wiki/Coconade "Coconade") fired from The 'Sea Legs' Cannon can be used to uncover X Marks the Spot Chests without the need of a Shovel, as long as the treasure is inside the firing range of the Cannon.
  + Same thing applies to most objects that Tools can be used on, e.g. [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree"), [Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder"), [Bamboo Patches](/wiki/Bamboo_Patch "Bamboo Patch") etc. Flammable objects will not be set on fire from the explosion that destroys them, nor will their drops, with the exception of Trees.
* The 'Sea Legs' Cannon can be used to easily kill [Birds](/wiki/Birds "Birds"), [Crabbits](/wiki/Crabbits "Crabbits"), [Dogfishes](/wiki/Dogfish "Dogfish") and [Jellyfishes](/wiki/Jellyfish "Jellyfish").
  + Since it does not aggro enemies hit with it, it is a very easy tool to effortlessly kill [Whales](/wiki/Whale "Whale"). Hitting a freshly killed Whale with it will result in them going in the second stage of bloating.
    - The Cannon can also be used instead of the [Machete](/wiki/Machete "Machete") to harvest fully bloated Whales.
* Whenever it lands on water, the Coconade of the Cannon will create [Big Waves](/wiki/Waves "Waves") that will travel outward from the point of impact. Their direction is coded in a way that one will always target Woodleg's position on the time the Cannon was fired, so it is not advised to stay in one place while using the Cannon.
* The perk of the Lucky Hat will still trigger when worn by a Prime Ape or Wildbore, albeit only 66% of the time. This can be exploited by giving multiple Hats to a lot of them and have a lot of X Marks the Spots spawn at the same time.
* Fighting the [Quacken](/wiki/Quacken "Quacken") early on can be very beneficial, as the [Booty Bag](/wiki/Booty_Bag "Booty Bag") it drops can passively provide many Dubloons for Woodlegs' special items in the long run. This is particularly useful in [Hurricane Season](/wiki/Hurricane_Season "Hurricane Season"), as Pirate Parrots do not spawn.
