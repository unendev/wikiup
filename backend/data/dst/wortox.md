## Minimap Maxwell's Door Origin[]

**“**A playful imp with a colourful past, Wortox was once a gentle (if rascally) forest creature without a care in the world -- until the day he inherited a terrible curse, and lost a close friend. Unlike the other Survivors, he does not appear to be trapped in the Constant. Perhaps he views this as some sort of game?**”**

Don't Starve Together Possessions Wortox Animated Short

 

Wortox's backstory is revealed in the animated short *[Possessions](/wiki/Animated_shorts_and_trailers#Possessions "Animated shorts and trailers")*, the details of which are summarized in his biography from the [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium"):

*Wortox learned the hard way that one should always be mindful of the company they keep. Once a playful imp without a care in the world, Wortox spent his days helping a [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") make mischief throughout the [Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant"). While the pair of rascals revelled in their roguery for a time, Wortox slowly began to see a darkness in the Krampus' heart, and the malice in his pranks. Not wishing for any real harm to come to anyone, the little imp finally put his cloven foot down, but in trying to stop his fiendish friend he unwittingly awakened a terrible power in himself...*

* Gameplay of Wortox was leaked on March 27th, 2019 (one day before his release) by sponsored Twitch streamer RTGameCrowd. [[7]](#cite_note-7) It was later confirmed by Klei that they did not intend for this streamer to reveal Wortox so early, nor would he be the only streamer to get access to Wortox. [[8]](#cite_note-8)
* Wortox is one of three characters to have more than one [ghost](/wiki/Ghost_Characters "Ghost Characters") transformation, with the others being [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie"), [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") and [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt"). He is also one of three characters to have different ghost designs for each of his skins.
* Wortox is the second DST-exclusive character, the first being [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona").
* Wortox is the second DST character to receive a special idle animation after [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood").[[9]](#cite_note-9) In his idle animation, Wortox smiles and dances.
* The horn of an old Wortox was found in Wilson's file from the Hamlet DLC menu beta and SW DLC menu.

### Lore[]

* Wortox is described by Klei as "a fun, mischievous fellow with a big, kind heart… minus the fact that he eats souls for sustenance."
* Unlike the other survivors, Wortox wasn't trapped in the [Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant"). He arrived through the [Ancient Gateway](/wiki/Ancient_Gateway "Ancient Gateway"), according to his examination quote for the structure when deactivated. His place of origin is unknown.
* Wortox may know who the [Ancient Statue](/wiki/Ancient_Statue "Ancient Statue") depicts, judging by his quote. ("Hyuyu, did you lose a game?")
* Wortox has a mother, according to his quote for the [Lavae Tooth](/wiki/Lavae_Tooth "Lavae Tooth"). ("My mom still has mine somewhere.")
* Wortox's quotes reveal parts of his nature as an imp.
  + He might not have blood. (Held [Mosquito](/wiki/Mosquito "Mosquito")- "I have no blood for you, sweet thing.")
  + The act of eating and preparing physical food is unpleasant and foreign. ([Flower Salad](/wiki/Flower_Salad "Flower Salad")- "I don't really like eating."/[Froggle Bunwich](/wiki/Froggle_Bunwich "Froggle Bunwich")- "Mortals are weird.")
  + He also can't digest food properly, and it might upset his stomach. ([Pumpkin Cookies](/wiki/Pumpkin_Cookies "Pumpkin Cookies")- "Real food is a bit hard on my stomach."/[Spicy Chili](/wiki/Spicy_Chili "Spicy Chili")- "I don't "digest" well."/ [Hot Pumpkin](/wiki/Pumpkin "Pumpkin")- "Slightly easier on my impish tum.")
  + He is sensitive to the sound of the [Lucky Whistle](/wiki/Year_of_the_Varg#Lucky_Whistle "Year of the Varg"). ("Ooo, ouch! My ears!").
  + His curse manifests through his hands, and many of his lines suggest that he cannot touch others without risking the theft of their soul. (Failure to craft- "My hands are truly cursed."/Holding a [Crow](/wiki/Crow "Crow")- "Careful, don't touch my hands.")
  + He dislikes [Garlic](/wiki/Garlic "Garlic") and [Salt](/wiki/Salt_Crystals "Salt Crystals"), hissing at the items, and is glad when [Salt Formations](/wiki/Salt_Formation "Salt Formation") are destroyed. Despite this, he is able to consume both with no negative effects apart from the usual reduced stat gains.
  + He is unable to cry. ([Onion](/wiki/Onion "Onion")- "You'll see no tears from my eye. I cannot cry!")
  + He might have regularly eaten physical food at some point in the past. ([Fancy Spiralled Tubers](/wiki/Fancy_Spiralled_Tubers "Fancy Spiralled Tubers")- "I think I remember when I used to eat food. Maybe.")
  + He may have hatched from an egg, judging by his quote for the [Lavae Tooth](/wiki/Lavae_Tooth "Lavae Tooth") ("My mom still has mine somewhere."), and the fact that the Lavae Tooth is the egg tooth of the [Extra-Adorable Lavae](/wiki/Extra-Adorable_Lavae "Extra-Adorable Lavae").
* Wortox's birthday is listed as March 28 in the Compendium. March 28, 2019 was the day Wortox was added to DST.
* To the forum question "there's art with 2 separate characters eating cup noodles, where did the cup noodles come from?" developer nome replied: "Wortox gave it to the Survivors because he thought it was cups of worms and would be a fun prank. He was very disappointed to find out it is, in fact, food. Nobody knows where he got them from."[[10]](#cite_note-10)

### Cultural References[]

* [Imps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imp "wikipedia:Imp") are mythological creatures. In German folklore they were considered lesser beings known for their prankish nature, but were later Christianized into being attendants of the devil himself.
* Wortox is also the name of a Swedish Death Metal band. [[11]](#cite_note-11)
* Wortox being voiced by a violin may be a reference to the cultural association of the violin (and music in general) with the devil.[[12]](#cite_note-12)
* His old design resembled [Hellboy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellboy "wikipedia:Hellboy").
* Within the *An Eye for an Eye* trailer, a pixelated Wortox appears out of thin air and reverts to his normal appearance, holding the [Terrarium](/wiki/Terrarium "Terrarium"). This suggests it was he who first brought it into the Constant, and is reinforced by his quote for a normal Terrarium ("A souvenir of sorts, hyuyu!") and [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell")'s for an empty one. ("I'd bet it was that insufferable imp who brought it here.")
* The fact that Wortox's favorite food is [Pomegranate](/wiki/Pomegranate "Pomegranate") may be a reference to the myth of Hades and Persephone, where Persephone is partially confined to the underworld after eating part of a [Pomegranate](/wiki/Pomegranate "Pomegranate").
