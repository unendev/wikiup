**Armor** is any in-game [Item](/wiki/Items "Items") that mitigates damage and protects the character from harm. It works by absorbing a portion of incoming damage in place of the wearer's (character or mob) [Health](/wiki/Health "Health"). Note that an armor's [Durability](/wiki/Durability "Durability") is decreased every time it blocks damage.

## Calculations[]

When the character or mob is wearing **both** chest armor and head armor, the total received damage would be distributed as follows:

1. Initial damage is absorbed by the *primary armor*.
2. Leftover damage is absorbed by the *secondary armor*.
3. Unabsorbed damage is then subtracted from the character's or mob's Health.

It is difficult to tell without getting hit first or using a mod which item is designated as primary or secondary armor. Re-equipping them or reloading the game *can* change this order. The damage subtracted from the character's Health is the same despite the order.

Example: Attack damage of a [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen") (80) to a character or mob equipped with a Grass Suit (*primary armor*) and a Football Helmet(*secondary armor*) will be distributed as follows:

* 80 × 60% = 48 damage is absorbed by the Grass Suit
* (80 − 48) × 80% = 25.6 damage is absorbed by the Football Helmet
* 80 − 48 − 25.6 = 6.4 damage is subtracted from the character or mob's Health

Calculation can be simplified to: 80 × (1 − 60%) × (1 − 80%) = 6.4

In a generic form:

`damage * (1 - primary armor) * (1 - secondary armor) = damage taken`

Note that the damage taken does not change when the primary and secondary values are switched, only how durability is lost is affected.

## Primary & secondary armor[]

The game itself does not distinguish any sort of pre-defined priorities of armor, instead takes them on the fly. While it might be hard to keep track of what armor receives the most damage, it is manageable.

Primary armor, i.e. the armor that absorbs the most damage, is always the last equipped. In order to save one's helmet, they would equip the helmet first, then the suit. If a suit is hot switched (replaced right away) it keeps its position. However, if there is any moment in which the helmet slot is empty (occurs when a helmet breaks, even if the player has a replacement in their inventory), the helmet assumes the primary slot and the suit has to be re-equipped.

It has been reported that reloading the game could change the positions. If not sure what armor is primary, just unequip the suit and equip it again, and the suit will become the primary.

Keep in mind that even the most beaten up log/grass suit still retains its original fuel value, therefore does not have to be used up. Instead of heading into the battle with an armor with low durability, risking the helmet assuming primary slot mid-fight, try equipping the shiny new suit and leaving the old one for when the night comes.
