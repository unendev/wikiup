## Minimap Maxwell's Door Origin[]

**“** Wigfrid longs for her glory days on the stage, and the role that rocketed her to stardom. Unable to move on from the past, she finds herself retreating more and more into a world of fantasy…**”**

–From the official Youtube description for *The Curtain Calls*

 File:Don%27t Starve Together The Curtain Calls Wigfrid Animated Short 

Don't Starve Together The Curtain Calls Wigfrid Animated Short

 

Wigfrid's backstory was revealed in the animated short *[The Curtain Calls](/wiki/Animated_shorts_and_trailers#The_Curtain_Calls "Animated shorts and trailers")*. The short is officially summarized in DST's [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium"):

*Wigfrid always knew she was meant for the stage. Her debut performance was an instant sensation, launching her from obscurity to overnight stardom. Fans delighted in her portrayal of a noble and fearsome Valkyrie warrior, and she in turn took great pains to fully embody the role. She was perfect for it... perhaps too perfect. Every part she played afterward seemed to fall flat, never again achieving that magical quality that had once drawn audiences to her performances like bees to honey. As Wigfrid’s stardom slowly began to fade, she retreated to the memories of her glory days, losing herself in her fantasies...*

*Until one day, she was lost entirely.*

## Placeholder Trivia[]

### In-Game[]

* Wigfrid was added to *Don't Starve: Reign of Giants* in the *[A Feet of Strength](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants#March_12.2C_2014_-_A_Feet_of_Strength_Forums_Beta_Update "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* update on March 12, 2014.
* In *Don't Starve*, anytime Wigfrid uses the letter "O", she says it with umlauts ("Ö"), even if there are two in a row. In DST, only the first of consecutive "O"s will have an umlaut. Umlauts can be toggled in the settings, using the "Umlautify" option.
* Wigfrid is voiced by very processed brass horns.[[4]](#cite_note-4)
* Despite Butterfly Wings/butter muffins being made from an animal, she cannot eat them.
* Wigfrid’s birthday is listed as March 23rd in the [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium").
* While being described as excellent in combat, Wigfrid's bonuses are outclassed by those of other characters; most also have higher Hunger and Sanity while lacking her inability to eat non-meat foods. On the other hand, Wigfrid is the only character to have combat bonuses in so many fields (attack power, damage resistance, starting equipment, and health/Sanity regeneration), and she also lacks the other characters' weaknesses; overall, she is a "[Jack of all trades, master of none](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats)" type of character when it comes to fighting. When compared to three of the other "combat-focused" characters:
  + [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang") eclipses Wigfrid in Health and damage output when he enters his Mighty form. However, Wolfgang's advantages require him to keep up his Hunger meter, and he has no innate damage resistance no matter how full his belly is. Additionally, he has more difficulties managing his Sanity in combat, due to a lack of innate Sanity restoration and increased Sanity drain when near monsters.
  + Compared to Wigfrid, [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie")'s Werebeaver form has superior damage resistance, its attacks are only slightly weaker than her Battle Spear (including Wigfrid's innate damage bonus), and it also has night vision to better operate in the dark. On the other hand, the Werebeaver is hampered by its inability to carry items and the need to maintain the Beaverness meter, leaving Woodie extremely vulnerable when he inevitably reverts to his human form.
  + [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell") has better starting equipment than Wigfrid, and his innate Sanity regeneration is much more efficient than hers; it restores more Sanity per tick and isn't reliant on being in combat. That being said, Maxwell lacks innate combat bonuses, leaving him reliant on his equipment and summoned [Shadows](/wiki/Codex_Umbra "Codex Umbra"). He also has much more difficulty taking hits than Wigfrid, due to his low Health and lack of innate damage resistance.
  + Note that in *Don't Starve Together*, Wigfrid's Battle Songs spread buffs to other players as well as herself. These battle songs redefine her as character specialized in boosting the survivability and effectiveness of her teammates in combat situations, especially during boss battles.
* Wigfrid has a similar design to an unimplemented character, [Winnie](/wiki/Unimplemented_Characters#Winnie "Unimplemented Characters").
* Wigfrid was the first character to start with food in their inventory (the second being [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber")) and one of two characters that start with a weapon and armor (the other being Maxwell).
* When examining [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders"), she claims that they have eight legs, even though the Spiders in-game only have six.
* When struck by [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning"), Wigfrid has bones in her hair (similar to most of the other *Don't Starve* characters).
* When [The Gorge](/wiki/The_Gorge "The Gorge") event first began, Wigfrid's Culinarian skin was missing her blush. This was later fixed in an update.
* In DST, she has a unique idle animation in which she takes a bow.
* Wigfrid's skull was found in the DST files as of May 6, 2021.
* Initially, Wigfrid Moonbound Portrait featured a star instead of Alter's symbol. It was changed presumably due to associations with the Star of David. [[5]](#cite_note-5)

### Lore[]

* Wigfrid dislikes [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms"), according to her [examination quotes](/wiki/Wigfrid_quotes "Wigfrid quotes").
* Wigfrid is able to break character, as shown by her quotes when entering/leaving light ("And the curtain falls."; "I step intö the light!") and when examining a [Top Hat](/wiki/Top_Hat "Top Hat") ("It döesn't match my cöstume.") or a [Pirate Hat](/wiki/Pirate_Hat "Pirate Hat") ("This hat cönfuses my character... I mean, my söul.").
* Wigfrid's DST [loading screen vignette](/wiki/Vignettes "Vignettes") is accompanied by text that reveals a bit about her acting skills: *The valor and confidence of a Valkyrie didn't always come naturally to Wigfrid. She cultivated her strength and persona over many years through sheer force of will.*
* Since Wigfrid seems to be the name of the character she is playing, her real name is currently unknown. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a6/Wigrid%27sName.png/revision/latest?cb=20201120143545 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a6/Wigrid%27sName.png/revision/latest?cb=20201120143545 

  Her name is written on this page, but it is indecipherable because it is crossed out.

### Cultural References[]

* Wigfrid is referred to as Wathgrithr in the game files, which comes from the name of a Valkyrie, Ráðgríðr (Rathgrithr).
* Wigfrid's role as an actress may be a reference to the famous opera cycle by Richard Wagner called *[The Ring of The Nibelung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen "wikipedia:Der Ring des Nibelungen")*. Her name may be a reference to the same opera cycle's main character Siegfried, but the character is possibly based on the main female character, a valkyrie named Brynhilde.
* Her motto for DST is a reference to a [Shakespeare quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_world%27s_a_stage "wikipedia:All the world's a stage").
* Toni from *Rhymes with Play* #201 said that Wigfrid's Victorian skin is based on an illustration by Alphonse Mucha, which depicts Sarah Bernhardt as Prince Hamlet from the [titular Shakespeare play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet "wikipedia:Hamlet"). [[6]](#cite_note-6)
* Wigfrid's Contender skin set is called "The Ultimate Performer", which may be a reference to [The Ultimate Warrior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ultimate_Warrior "wikipedia:The Ultimate Warrior"), a professional wrestler. Her mask even calls to mind The Ultimate Warrior's famous face paint.
  + Her Contender skin includes boxing gloves and pigtails that may be referencing Maggie from *[Million Dollar Baby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Dollar_Baby "wikipedia:Million Dollar Baby")*.
* Her The Snowfallen skin possibly refers to frost giant or [Jötnar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunn) from norse mythology.

I suggest changing the shape of the star to be something more like these. both the portrait and skin for reference. note that the resemblance is more apparent in her portrait.
