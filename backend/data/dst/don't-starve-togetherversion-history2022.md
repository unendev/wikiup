## **August 4, 2022 - Wickerbottom Character Update**[]

Rev. 517836 (Release)

**One For the Books**

Like any good librarian, Ms. Wickerbottom believes in the preservation and distribution of knowledge. Well… most knowledge, that is. There are some things that must be kept hidden away from the eyes of the public. Who knows what could happen if certain secrets fell into the wrong hands?

The Wickerbottom Refresh is now available on Steam and will be available on Xbox and Playstation shortly. Nintendo Switch will be getting this refresh in an upcoming update as we work toward unifying game versions on console.

**Changes**

* WickerBottom
  + Wickerbottom can no longer be forced to fall asleep.
  + Wickerbottom can now craft the following new books:
    - The Angler's Survival Guide
    - Pyrokinetics Explained
    - Overcoming Arachnophobia
    - Tempering Temperatures
    - Lux Aeterna
    - Practical Rain Rituals
    - Lunar Grimoire
    - Apicultural Notes
    - Horticulture, Expanded
    - The Everything Encyclopedia
    - Lux Aeterna Redux
    - Wickerbottom can also build a cabinet to help conserve her books.
  + Tuned Wickerbottom’s stats when it comes to eating stale and spoiled food and her health.
  + Shadow Creatures now Spawn when Wickerbottom attempts to read her books while insane
* Added the Hostile Flare.
* Added the Fencing Sword for riposting fences.

**Additional Changes**

* Maxwell now suffers 2.5 times the sanity costs as Wickerbottom when reading Wickerbottom’s books.
* Wortox Changes
  + Wortox will be able to Soul Hop to past explored locations through the Map.
  + The cost of souls is proportional to the distance traveled.
  + There are visual indicators to show cost increases.
  + Wortox will now be able to Soul Hop a second time for free if done within a short time of the last.
    - Wortox will get slightly more hunger from eating souls.
    - Wortox will gain a small amount of sanity for being healed by a soul.
  + Wortox Souls now only heal hurt players and have more diminishing returns when healing groups of hurt players.
  + The Wortox who deals the killing strike is guaranteed at least one soul.
    - This is intended to help prevent fighting for nearby souls when souls are being created but prevent boss soul drops from being fully claimed.

**New Skins!**

**Wickerbottom Deluxe Wardrobe** ($10.99usd).

This Deluxe Wardrobe contains Wickerbottom's complete set of Guest of Honor, Roseate, Survivor, Triumphant, and Nom de Plume skin items.

**Library Chest** ($3.99usd)

This Library Chest contains the following skin items: Mind's Eye Life Amulet, Walnut Bookstack, and Library Placard.

**New Twitch Drops!**

We're offering a new set of streaming drops over on Twitch.tv. Check out this post for details.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

We are experimenting with the viewing requirements for Twitch items.

View time on Twitch will now be accrued concurrently and no longer sequentially. This means that viewers will get credit for ALL time they spend watching stream and will no longer need to claim one item before earning time for the next item. However, viewers will still want to make sure they claim all items before the campaign ends.

Please be aware that this may change again in the future, but we want to see how this works out so we thought we would give it a try. Let us know what you think on the thread for the new drop here.

**And that's all for now.**

On to the next update! Unfortunately, I can't share anything about this one yet, there is still work to be done backstage. But - we'll make sure to share something well before showtime.

Last but not least. Have some points.

Thanks again everybody and have fun out there!

Batten down the hatches survivors, we got another swell update for you! In one of our largest updates to date, we've got all kinds of good stuff for you today.

**The Curse of Moon Quay**

Someone has been meddling... or should we say, monkeying around with the forces of the Constant, leaving an unstable rift between worlds in their wake. With new sea-faring foes, creatures and resources now free to pour into the Survivors' world, the ocean is more dangerous than ever before... but is this just the start of what's to come?

Once again, thanks to everybody that helped us with bugs and feedback during the beta!

**NOTE:** PlayStation and Xbox players will be getting this earlier than originally posted. Against all odds, the team managed to pull everything together in time to get this out to you sooner than expected. We now expect this to be out today or tomorrow. However, this isn't entirely under our control, so it's not impossible for it slip to early next week.

For New Features see the spoiler below:

* New Moon Quay Island and inhabitants.
* Ocean Privateers.
* New upgrades for boating:
  + Grass Boat
  + Kelp Bumper
  + Shell Bumper
  + Cannon and Cannonballs
  + Rudder
  + Trawler
  + Polly Roger's Hat
* Docks
* Nautopilot and Nautopilot Beacon
* New perspectives on life.

Additional Changes:

* Map controls will now be more intuitive.
  + Zooming will now focus on the cursor.
    - An option in the advanced settings can be used to disable this feature.
  + Zooming in and out will now be smooth.
    - An option in the advanced settings controls how fast zooming is.
  + Rotating the map will be around the current location and not the player.
  + Controllers will see a smooth directional panning experience.
  + Panning the map will try to keep a portion of the map visible on the center of the screen.
  + Some mods that interact with the map or create new map instances may need to be updated for some of these features to work.
* Favorite food bonus now takes into account Warly’s spices.
  + Mods that require a spiced food will still function as expected. Having an affinity for a spiced variant and a regular food item will use whichever gives the most benefit.
* Cactus and Oasis Cactus have been added to world regrowth.
* Reeds and Cactus now have settings for world regrowth.
* Big Woby will now eat the food given to her instead of staring at it.

**Klei Rewards!**

And if that wasn't enough, you can use those Klei Reward points you have been saving up for some cool new stuff on the Klei Rewards page.

With this update, we're adding all the previous skins from the Nautical Collection to the Klei Rewards page as well!

**Rhymes With Play**

**That's all for now!**

And here's the part where I say some stuff about what we have next. We're not that far away from the next character refresh. Unfortunately, there isn't a single frame from the next short that won't be some sort of spoiler. We only have a few survivors left. So we're just gonna have to remain tight-lipped this time. Don't lose sleep over it though, we'll have plenty for you to checkout soon.

See ya soon!

## **April 28, 2022** - WX-78 Character Update[]

Rev. 505690 (Release)

Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue causing the Bio Scanalyzer's scan ring to become invisible if a scan failed and restarted too quickly.

Changes

* Added a Get More Help button on the Dedicated Server Failed To Start popup.
* Bottomless Pit, Stone Kiln and Carved Stone Torch skins are usable on all platforms now, and have been upgraded to Timeless rarity. A new Loyal variant is available on the Klei Rewards page.
* Updated Credits.

Rev. 505508 (Release)

The WX-78 Update is available now on Xbox, PlayStation and Steam. Nintendo Switch will be getting this update in an upcoming update.

We're working on a large update to catch Nintendo Switch up with all platforms now that it's released with the goal of keeping it updated in line with them. Stay tuned for more details specific to Nintendo Switch.

**Disconnected**

After the wiring to their long-unused empathy module is repaired, WX-78 finds themselves suddenly reconnecting with memories they’d hoped to keep buried.

**WX-78 Changes**

* WX-78 can create circuits that can be installed to unlock special abilities.
* WX-78 can unplug their circuits by utilizing a Circuit Extractor. Unfortunately, this means losing any charge that the circuits were taking up!
* WX-78 learns how to construct circuits by scanning organics with their Bio Scanalyzer.
* The Bio Scanalyzer also produces Bio Data, which is used to create circuits, alongside material from the scanned organic.
* WX-78's circuits are powered by their electrical charge meter. The meter restores itself over time, and can also be restored by other means.
* If WX-78 gets too wet, they begin losing electricity. If they run out of electricity, they begin to lose health.
* WX-78 also loses electricity when they are starving, as they no longer have the energy to maintain their charge level.
* WX-78 can eat gears to regain health, sanity, and hunger. If WX-78 dies, they will drop some of the gears that they have eaten.
* Clockworks are less aggressive towards WX-78.

**Additional Changes**

**Misc.**

* New HUD effects have been added for when learning recipes.
* Improved creature AI when a group of creatures are running together.
* Reeds will now regrow during Spring after having been burnt.

**Wurt**

* When Wurt wears the Seawreath or Garland, the sanity effects are flipped.
* Improved how hats look on Wurt
* Moose/Goose and Bearger no longer knock items out of Wurt’s hands, because of her strong grip.
* The Clever Disguise now lasts for 15 days.
* Abandoned Merm followers will now return home after some time.
* Merms now play a hungry animation when their loyalty is low.
* Feeding Merms will now also improve the loyalty of a few nearby Merms.
* Merms no longer tolerate their leader murdering a fish.
* Merms that are followers will defend other nearby Merms when they are attacked.
* Merms will stop mining and chopping if their leader gets too far away.
* Merms no longer get hurt from eating kelp or durians.
* Frogs are no longer aggressive towards Merms.
* The Merm King’s eating animation duration is now based on the quality of the food.
* The Merm King now gives bonus Gold Nuggets when given an ocean fish.
* The Merm King now gives Cut Reeds instead of Rot when given a fish.

We have decided to revert the mouse targeting changes from the March 2022 Quality of Life update regarding attacking enemies and repeating actions while the mouse button is held down. These will now behave as they were before that update. We will be working to bring them back when they can spend some more time being tested internally.

* Actions like harvesting grass with the mouse have returned to require clicking each one instead of holding down the mouse button.
* Repeating actions where you use the same item, such as cooking on a fire or feeding Beefalo are still functional.
* Combat targeting with the mouse button has returned to the state where you must completely stop attacking before the target can be changed. Fixing this is a high priority task.
* This should also resolve issues around holding F to attack, delays between attacks, and some crashes.

**New Skins!**

**WX-78 Deluxe Wardrobe ($10.99 / 19 RMB).**

This Deluxe Wardrobe contains WX-78's complete set of Guest of Honor, Roseate, Survivor, Triumphant, and Experimental skin items.

**Experimental Chest $3.99 (8 RMB)**

This Experimental Chest contains the following belongings skin items: Electrified Lantern, Experimental Energy Siphon, and Experimentation Apparatus.

**New Twitch Drops!**

We're offering a new set of streaming drops over on Twitch.tv. Check out this post for details.

**Shared Unlocks Now Available**

We have made shared unlocks now available for Xbox, Steam and Nintendo Switch and WeGame.

For more information see our support post here.

**Note to Nintendo Switch Players**

We have an update coming out for you soon that will address some performance issues. We're also working on additional updates that will catch Nintendo Switch up a bit closer with the other platforms.

We will have more information for you as soon as it's available.

**Have some points!**

Hey look, points. We like points. Here, have some. On me.

**And that's all for now.**

I don't have information about the next update quite yet, but we do have something exciting to announce. We are currently in the process of making skins and unlocks available to players while playing offline on Nintendo Switch . We're investigating this for additional platforms as well. More details on how that will work will come at a later time.

Thanks again everybody and have fun out there!

Rev. 502346 (Release)

Crafting

* Item Priority for crafting has been changed to the following:
  + Crafting will attempt to choose items with the smallest stack size
  + All open containers except backpacks first
    - If stack counts are the same, it will choose items closer to the bottom of the container.
  + Your inventory is next
    - If stack counts are the same, it will choose items closest to the left side of your inventory.
  + Your backpack is next
    - If stack counts are the same, it will choose items closest to the left side(integrated backpack) or top(separated backpack) of your backpack.
  + Finally, if you have an item on your mouse cursor, it will try that item.
* Ingredients required for a recipe can now be crafted directly from that recipe.
  + Eg: if you want to build a spear and have 2 twigs, 1 flint, 3 cut grass. When you attempt to build the spear, it will build the rope first, instead of requiring you to find the rope’s recipe and then head back to the spear’s recipe.

    - STRINGS.UI.CRAFTING\_FILTERS.MUSIC = “Best Music Ever”

Rev. 499972 (Release)

Hey everybody!

The March Quality of Life update is now live for all players! Once again, a huge thanks to everybody that joined us on the beta branch and sent in feedback and suggestions. That feedback directly helped influence and improve the final design of the new crafting menu.

There are still a few things that will be added throughout the next week(s). These include: Adding pages for the pinned recipe bar and changing them to be stored on the profile instead of per world, a system to support crafting refined ingredients directly from the currently selected recipe, optimizations, and mod support for adding new filters.

**Crafting Menu Features**

* Redesigned the Crafting UI
* Moved from items being in a specific tab to a filter approach, which allows players to easily find the items they are looking for.
* Recipes can be added to a favorites
* Recipes can be pinned to the side of the screen for quick crafting
* Use the text search to find items by their localized name.
* The size of the crafting menu can be scaled separately from the rest of the HUD.
* Players who use controllers can:
* Move and rotate the camera while the crafting menu is open
* Use the right analog stick to navigate through the pinned recipes and craft them without opening the crafting menu

**Wolfgang Changes**

* Wolfgang now gains a small amount of mightiness while performing physical activity, such as chopping and mining.
* Improved the efficiency, durability and ingredient cost for all dumbbells.
* Running with dumbbells equipped pauses the mightiness drain.
* Increased the top rowing speed when Wolfgang is Mighty

**Other Changes**

* The Ancient Guardian fight has been redesigned.
* Items within a treasure chest can now be used when crafting.
* Hound wave frequency has been reduced and Varglets will appear after the first year.
* Fire and Ice hounds can now be adjusted in the world settings
* Adjusted the crafting recipes for a number of items
* Terra Firma Tamper and Tackle Receptacle now allow you to prototype the recipe, so you will not have to stand beside one every time you wish to craft their items.
* And more!

**Note about the crafting menu changes.**

We are very aware that this is a drastic change however, moving away from the old menu allows us more freedom when adding craftable items. For example, the Tackle Receptacle and Terra Firma Tamper were only added because we did not want to add a dozen recipes into the survival and structures tab. With the new approach, this is no longer an issue. The Tackle Receptacle and Terra Firma Tamper have been changed to research stations, like the Science Machine, where you will be able to prototype the recipes, learning them forever.

We know that change can be difficult for some players. Please give the new menu a chance, consider the above information and let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions over on the official forums.

The full patch notes are a bit... much. But if you wanna check them out, hit the spoiler below.

**Crafting Menu Changes**

* Recipes are now organized in filters, logical groups of items that fulfill a role. You could think of them as quick keyword buttons for the search bar.
* Recipes can be pinned to the right hand side of the menu for easy access while the crafting menu is closed. Pinned recipes are saved on a per-world basis, allowing you to customize it depending on your progression or play style on each world.
* Recipes can be added to a favorites list by clicking the star icon next to the recipe’s name. Favorites are saved locally and will be shared between worlds.
* Search by localized name.
* The size of the crafting menu can be scaled separately from the rest of the HUD.
* Players can perform nearly any action while the crafting menu is open. Right-clicking on empty ground (when no right-click action is prompted) will close the menu.
* When using a controller, players can now move and rotate their camera while the menu is open.
* You can now craft with items inside chests.
* Clicking on research stations (prototypers) will open the crafting menu.
* Crafting Auto Pause can be enabled in the Options screen.
* Added the setting “Crafting Auto-Close” to enable or disable closing of the crafting menu when pre-crafting placeable structures. When the build button is labelled “Place” the crafting menu will still close regardless of the setting.
* This can be found in the Advanced settings page.
* Added the keybind “Crafting Menu (mod)”
  + Defaulted to Left Control
  + Holding this key while opening the crafting menu will enable the search box
  + Pressing Ctrl+C (assuming default binds) while the crafting menu is open will jump to the search box
  + Holding this button while pressing the “Inv 1” to “Inv 9” buttons will craft the recipe that is pinned in that slot number.

**Other Changes**

I know we mentioned big news last week, but it needs a little more time before we can announce. Hopefully we'll be able to get it out in the next couple weeks.

While part of the team has been working on putting in the final touches on the crafting menu changes, the rest of the team has been hard at work on the next two updates.

One of those updates is the next character refresh. I wonder who it might be?

And with that, we are done. I think. Oh, yeah. You probably want one of these. Have fun out there everybody!

Beta Hotfix

Here's one last hotfix before the update goes live tomorrow.

We’d like to give everyone a big thank you for testing this beta and providing feedback. There were a ton of ideas, many of which were implemented or influenced the final design. There were also a number of ideas that have been added to our backlog document, so if your idea did not make it into this QoL update, please don’t feel like your comments fell on deaf ears.

Although the QoL update will be going live tomorrow, there are still a few things that will be added throughout the next week(s).

  + If the mod character does not have a specific crafting menu icon, then it will fallback to "/images/avatars/avatar\_<name>.xml" with image "avatar\_<name>.tex"
  + These paths will also respect being redirected via MOD\_CRAFTING\_AVATAR\_LOCATIONS or MOD\_AVATAR\_LOCATIONS

Wolfgang

* Upon reviewing the motivation behind losing might when getting hit, we have decided that it was not achieving its purpose, and when comparing him to other characters it was deemed unnecessary. Therefore, it has been removed.
* The rate the Woflgang passively loses might has been increased.
* Only wimpy Wolfgang will use the punch animation when attacking with dumbbells.

Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where Wolfgang continued lifting weights after unequipping a dumbbell.

  + Deleted the function PlayerHud:IsCraftingAllowingGameplay()
* Loading tips
  + SetLoadingTipCategoryIcon(<tip\_category>, <atlas>, <icon>) changes the icon displayed beside the loading tip text.
    - <tip\_category> is a string name representing the tip category of the icon to replace. Refer to LOADING\_SCREEN\_TIP\_CATEGORIES in constants.lua for a list of tip categories.
    - <atlas>, <icon> are strings representing the image from a .tex file to use as the tip icon.
    - Note that icon assets must be pre-loaded. To do so, create an asset table in modmain.lua the same way you normally would, but call the table PreloadAssets instead of Assets then call ReloadPreloadAssets()

Rev. 497159 (Test)

We have been busy working on a number of things that we’ve heard people asking for. Hopefully a number of items have been crossed off your wish list.

**The Crafting Menu**

The crafting menu has changed from using tabs to filters and greatly increased the number of recipes that can be viewed without scrolling. Recipes can also be marked as favorites, allowing players to customize their own filter, and can be pinned for quick crafting while the menu is closed. These changes should make it a lot easier for players, especially new and casual players, to find and discover items to help them survive in the Constant.

At this time we will not be supporting the old crafting menu as moving away from that approach allows us for more freedom when adding craftable items. For example, the Tackle Receptacle and Terra Firma Tamper were only added because we did not want to add a dozen recipes into the survival and structures tab. With the new approach, this is not an issue. The Tackle Receptacle and Terra Firma Tamper have been changed to research stations, like the Science Machine, where you will be able to prototype the recipes, learning them forever.

From reading the responses to the announcement beta post, we’ve noticed that a number of people are feeling scared of the new crafting menu. We understand that a large UI change like this can be scary and often approached with hesitation (we understand how frustrating it is when our development tools, and even our phones, change when a new update comes out) but we would like to encourage everyone to play with the new menu before providing constructive feedback.

**Wolfgang Changes**

From hearing all your feedback about the Wolfgang refresh, we’ve decided it is best to put our revisions into the beta so they can be iterated on without affecting the community. We’ve made a number of changes and tweaks, mainly around providing ways for him to maintain might while sustaining a physically active lifestyle. The rate that might be gained from working out at the Mighty Gym and while lifting dumbbells has also been dramatically improved. The full details can be found below.

**Crafting Menu**

**New Features**

* Recipes can be added to a favorites list by clicking the star icon next to the recipe’s name. Favorites are saved locally and will be shared between worlds.
* Recipes can be pinned to the right hand side of the menu for easy access while the crafting menu is closed. Pinned recipes are saved on a per-world basis, allowing you to customize it depending on your progression or play style on each world.
* Filters are logical groups of items that fulfill a role. You could think of them as quick keyword buttons for the search bar.
* Text search currently searches by localized name, localized description, and prefab name. This will be expanded upon during the beta. It is currently quite slow even after the menu is closed, so please keep that in mind.
* The size of the crafting menu can be scaled separately from the rest of the HUD.
* Mods are able to add their recipes to any filter group using the new API. Existing mods will automatically have their recipes added to the Modded Items filter. This filter is located beside the sort button and will only appear if mods with crafting items are enabled.

**Work in Progress**

* Searching by text may drop your frame rate, even while the menu is closed.
* More recipe keywords for text searching.
* Pinned recipes is missing a recipe popup.
* Some filter icons are still placeholder.
* Controller support. You can navigate while the menu is open, but the pinned recipes are not currently supported. A lot more work will be done for controller support.
* Mod support: Support adding new filters.
* The space under the item description is still being assessed. (We had some other QoL ideas that did not make it in this update that would have utilized that area.)
* Blueprints dropped by tumbleweeds do not work.
* Enable freecrafting of statues and mad science potions.
* There are a lot of recipes in the game, some may not have ended up under the appropriate filter(s). Feel free to recommend items be added or removed from filters.

**Other Crafting Changes**

* Crafting will now use items from inside open treasure chests and other containers.
* Clicking on research stations (prototypers) will now open the crafting menu.
* Clicking on crafting stations (the objects you always have to stand beside to craft or trade an item) will now open the crafting menu with the filter set to that station.
* Wax paper, beeswax, and marble beans have been moved to science two
* Turfs crafted from the Terra Firma Tamper are now prototyped so you do not need to return to the Terra Firma Tamper every time you want to craft one.
* Lures, floats, and bobbers crafted from the Tackle Receptacle are now prototyped so you do not need to return to the Tackle Receptacle every time you want to craft one.
* The Waterfowl Can, Feather Weave, and Winged Sail Kit no longer require a blueprint drop from the Malbatross.
* The Boat Kit's recipe has been changed from Boards to Logs and no longer required the Think Tank.
* The Boat Patch, Oar, and Driftwood Oar no longer require the Think Tank to prototype.
* Reduced the cost of Boat Patches. The boat repair value has been adjusted to reflect the new cost.
* Changed the recipes for Mud Turf and Cobblestones to not include other turfs.
* Moders: Please switch from using AddRecipe to AddRecipe2 and AddDeconstructRecipe (for items that are dropped or world spawned and cannot be constructed). Calling AddRecipe will still work but you will not be able to specify specific filters to be listed in.
* When free crafting is enabled, you will be able to access all character specific crafting recipes.

**Wolfgang Changes**

* Added Marbell, a dumbbell made of marble. These are very heavy, but much more effective and durable than Golden Dumbbells.
* Improved the efficiency, durability and ingredient cost for all dumbbells.
* You can now right-click on Wolfgang to start and stop lifting dumbbells

* Wolfgang now gains mightiness while attacking, based on the target’s max health.
* Wolfgang now loses mightiness when hit, based on the initial damage amount (armor does not prevent mightiness loss).
* Wimpy Wolfgang now does 25% less “work” when chopping, mining and hammering, but also does 25% less wear on tools.
* Wimpy Wolfgang now has a 25% slower hunger drain
* Wimpy Wolfgang no longer takes 25% more damage
* Reduced the Wimpy and Mighty Wolfgang insulation values. Also, Mighty Wolfgang now has an easier time saying warm and a harder time saying cool, while Wimpy Wolfgang is the opposite.
* Fixed a bug where his movement speed was not being calculated correctly while hoping onto boats while mighty or wimpy

**Miscellaneous Changes**

* Ancient Guardian
* Ancient Guardian is a new fight. This is not intended to be a hard boss fight, but to be more fun than the previous version.
* Ancient Guardian’s loot table revised, better reflecting the biome and that you have to kill the Ancient Fuelweaver in order to fight it again.
