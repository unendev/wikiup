`"wortox"`

Wortox has a character-exclusive item, the [Soul](/wiki/Soul "Soul"). When [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") or fellow players die within 20 units of him, Souls will be spawned. Souls will immediately flow to Wortox when he is within 8 units of the Soul. If it is not collected within 10 seconds, it will disappear. Most Mobs will drop one Soul. Notably, [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") will drop two Souls and [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") does not drop any Souls. [Boss Monsters](/wiki/Category:Boss_Monsters "Category:Boss Monsters") will drop seven to eight Souls. If Wortox gets the killing blow on a monster he is guaranteed at least one soul, even if another Wortox is close by. At least one inventory space can be occupied with a maximum of 20 Souls. Wortox can eat Souls to restore 25 Hunger, but at the cost of 5 Sanity. He can release Souls to heal himself or nearby allies. Injured players standing within 8 units of the Soul's release will receive healing, however the amount of healing is decreased by 2 for each additional player healed, starting at 20 Health and reducing to a minimum of 5 Health, while always giving Wortox 2.5 Sanity. He can also spend one Soul to be able to Soul Hop, or teleport, a short distance. This functions in the same manner as [The Lazy Explorer](/wiki/The_Lazy_Explorer "The Lazy Explorer"), except it does not cost any Sanity. He can soul hop again once for free if done within a short enough time from the last, indicated by a cooldown timer. He can also soul hop to any explored location on the map, with cost increasing with distance up to a maximum of 20. Wortox will lose 50% less Sanity when being near [Monsters](/wiki/Monster "Monster") like [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider"), [Hounds](/wiki/Hound "Hound"), [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle"), etc.

## Disadvantage[]

Wortox's body craves Souls. This cuts the hunger, health, and sanity gain from regular [food](/wiki/Food "Food") by half. Negative effects from food will also be halved. For example, raw Meat will cause him to lose 5 Sanity instead of 10. Wortox will drop half of his Soul inventory and lose 20 Sanity when he tries to hold more than 20 Souls. When he receives his 17-18th soul, Wortox will say "I've enough souls to sustain me." or "I hope I was not too greedy." to indicate the player is reaching the soul limit. He cannot store Souls in external storage (such as a [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest") or [Backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack")), nor can any other character hold Souls. [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig"), [Catcoons](/wiki/Catcoon "Catcoon") and [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") are hostile to him and cannot be befriended, like Webber. Unlike Webber, Spiders will also be hostile to him.

## Prototype Tips[]

* To easily farm Souls, players can keep a few [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") around their base and kill the [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterfly "Butterfly") that spawn.
  + This method also allows the player to easily regain sanity by catching, planting, and picking Butterflies.
  + Other easy moveable mob spawners are spidernests & beehives.
* Because he's invincible while Soul Hopping, Wortox can use his Soul Hop ability to easily kite large mobs such as [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops") and [Bearger.](/wiki/Bearger "Bearger") Players can simply attack until the opponent is about to attack back, then Soul Hop while the enemy is attacking.
* Wortox can release Souls he has captured after a fight to heal himself and his allies.
* Soul Hopping is also a very practicle way of transporting heavy objects like [Suspicious Marble](/wiki/Suspicious_Marble "Suspicious Marble").
* Wortox can be extremely powerful when paired with a [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom"), as reading [Birds of the World](/wiki/Books#Birds_of_the_World "Books") and [Sleepytime Stories](/wiki/Books#Sleepytime_Stories "Books") in quick succession can result in many Souls captured.
  + He also works well with a [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang"), as Wolfgang can easily destroy enemies for souls and Wortox can leave all of the physical food for Wolfgang.
* In a PvP server, killing a Wortox will result in all of his Souls being released.
  + This can used to the player's personal advantage, targeting Wortox so they can heal themselves after he is killed.
* Wortox's [favorite food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is both raw and cooked [Pomegranate](/wiki/Pomegranate "Pomegranate"), meaning he gains 2.8125 / 1.25 bonus Hunger when consuming the food despite his usual aversion to normal foods.
* When farming (i.e. tilling soil with a ([Splendid](/wiki/Splendid_Garden_Hoe "Splendid Garden Hoe")) [Garden Hoe](/wiki/Garden_Hoe "Garden Hoe")) one has to be careful to not waste [Souls](/wiki/Soul "Soul") by accidentally Soul Hopping by right clicking a non-tillable spot (as both tilling and Soul Hopping are usually executed by right clicking the mouse)
