## Bonfire[]

The **Bonfire** is a removed [Structure](/wiki/Structure "Structure"). [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") used to spawn at Bonfires, before they were replaced by [Pig Houses](/wiki/Pig_House "Pig House"). They automatically started at [Night](/wiki/Night "Night"), however, the [Fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire") did not cast any light. The player was able to cook [Food](/wiki/Food "Food") over a Bonfire even when it was not lit. Its spawn code was `"bonfire"`.

## Farm Plot[]

The **Farm Plot** was a feature in beta versions of *Don't Starve* and it required 6 Grass and 8 Manure to craft without any science. It was a slower version of the basic farm.

## Gemology Tab[]

**Gemology** was a crafting tab used to make the various [Gem](/wiki/Gem "Gem")-based items in the game. The recipes from the tab still exist, but they have since been split between the [Magic Tab](/wiki/Magic_Tab "Magic Tab") and the [Ancient Tab](/wiki/Ancient_Tab "Ancient Tab"). They included [Life Giving Amulet](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet"), [Chilled Amulet](/wiki/Chilled_Amulet "Chilled Amulet"), [Nightmare Amulet](/wiki/Nightmare_Amulet "Nightmare Amulet"), [The Lazy Forager](/wiki/The_Lazy_Forager "The Lazy Forager"), [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff"), [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff"), [Telelocator Staff](/wiki/Telelocator_Staff "Telelocator Staff"), [Star Caller's Staff](/wiki/Star_Caller%27s_Staff "Star Caller's Staff") and [Telelocator Focus](/wiki/Telelocator_Focus "Telelocator Focus").

## https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b0/Don%27t Starve Together icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20150127043033Different Shadow Puppets[]

Initially, Shadow Puppets are not universal, instead they have to be chosen upon creation of which task they will be specialized in. As such, they do not mimic the actions that the player is performing, but instead spawn with a specific task which they perform. They also do not disappear after 2.5 days nor have a durability limit and stay active until they are killed. To dispel them, Maxwell or any other character can simply force attack (Ctrl/Cmnd) click them. Shadow Puppets will drop 1 Nightmare Fuel when killed or dispelled by players.

## Importing[]

Before the *[Doorway to Adventure](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve/Version_History "Don't Starve/Version History")* update, it was possible to **import** a [save](/wiki/Saving "Saving") for the steam version of *Don't Starve* from a backed up region that could be found in the steam directory. This feature has since been removed.

## https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b0/Don%27t Starve Together icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20150127043033 Jury-Rigged Portal[]

**“**It's rickety, but it appears to function. After a fashion...**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

The **Jury-Rigged Portal** was a previously naturally spawning [Structure](/wiki/Structure "Structure") in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* that served as a spawn point for newly joined players. It could also be used to resurrect [Ghost Players](/wiki/Ghost_Characters "Ghost Characters") when playing in Endless Mode.

Lore-wise, the Jury-Rigged Portal was first featured in a comic used to announce *Don't Starve Together*, as silhouetted characters could be seen emerging from it. Later, it was revealed that [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell") helped [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") build it. It was then destroyed and replaced with the [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern") by [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") upon the game leaving [Early Access](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History "Don't Starve Together/Version History"), though it is functionally the same thing.

The **Malfunctioning Novelty Ride** was part of a [Set Piece](/wiki/Set_Piece "Set Piece") in the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* DLC. It was found near a [Skeleton](/wiki/Skeleton "Skeleton") in any land [Biome](/wiki/Biome "Biome") and served as a placeholder for the [Seaworthy](/wiki/Seaworthy "Seaworthy") Portal. The Malfunctioning Novelty Ride can no longer be spawned into the game, as its prefab was completely replaced in the *[Wilbur Vs. The Volcano](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked#February_4th,_2016_-_Wilbur_Vs._The_Volcano_Update "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* update.

## Note[]

**Notes** were items dropped by [Birds](/wiki/Birds "Birds") on May 1st, 2014. They were part of a puzzle, eventually hinting to the release of *Don't Starve Together*, and displaying coordinates to be used on a special map. Other than reading them, the only use for Notes was as a [Fuel](/wiki/Fuel "Fuel") source. There were 17 different coordinates in total:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (-16, 16) | 7 ( -4, -8) | 20 (-22, 1) | 60 ( 6,-23) |
| 2 (-22, 9) | 8 ( 20, -2) | 30 (-10,-16) | 100 (-14, 16) |
| 3 ( 10,-16) | 9 ( 2, 20) | 40 ( 16, -2) | 300 (-6, 13) |
| 4 (-11, -4) | 10 (-13, 8) | 50 ( 13, -7) | 400 (-18, 6) |
| 5 ( 6, 2) |

When a Note was examined, a line of code in the console ended with "It's Greek to me.", an idiom expressing the speaker does not understand something. In this case, however, it was also a hint at the answers to parts of the puzzle.

**Research Points** were used to unlock new [Crafting](/wiki/Crafting "Crafting") recipes and were acquired by putting [Items](/wiki/Item "Item") into a [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") or [Alchemy Engine](/wiki/Alchemy_Engine "Alchemy Engine"). Each item gave a specific amount of points. In the *[Insanity!](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve/Version_History "Don't Starve/Version History")* update, this feature was removed and replaced by Prototyping.

## Road Turf[]

**Road Turf** was one of the [Turf](/wiki/Turf "Turf") [Items](/wiki/Items "Items") acquired by digging [Road](/wiki/Road "Road") tiles with a [Pitchfork](/wiki/Pitchfork "Pitchfork"). Like other [Turfs](/wiki/Turfs "Turfs"), it could be placed on any bare ground tile. The player's speed was increased when walking on Road Turf. Road Turfs did stack up to 10 and had a fuel value of 45/90 Sec. Road Turfs have been replaced by [Cobblestones](/wiki/Cobblestones "Cobblestones"). Roads are now permanent and can no longer be dug up with a Pitchfork.

It could only be used once and dealt 100 damage per shot. Spearguns required 1 [Seashell](/wiki/Seashell "Seashell"), 3 [Bamboo](/wiki/Bamboo "Bamboo"), and 1 [Jellyfish](/wiki/Jellyfish "Jellyfish") to craft, and a [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") to prototype. They were found in the [Fight Tab](/wiki/Fight_Tab "Fight Tab") and stacked up to 20. Their spawn code was `"speargun"`.

### Poison Speargun[]

The **Poison Speargun** was a [Poisonous](/wiki/Poison "Poison") version of the Speargun. In addition to dealing 100 damage on hit, it also would poison the target. Poison Spearguns required 3 Seashell, 1 Bamboo and 1 [Venom Gland](/wiki/Venom_Gland "Venom Gland") to craft. Their spawn code was `"speargun_poison"`.

### Obsidian Speargun[]

In addition to dealing 100 damage on hit, the **Obsidian Speargun** would also [ignite](/wiki/Fire "Fire") the target, unless used in the [Hurricane Season](/wiki/Hurricane_Season "Hurricane Season"). Obsidian Spearguns used 3 Seashell, 3 Bamboo and 1 [Obsidian](/wiki/Obsidian "Obsidian") to craft. Prototyping them required using either their [Blueprint](/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") or a [Brain of Thought](/wiki/Brain_of_Thought "Brain of Thought"). Their spawn code was `"obsidianspeargun"`.

**Sticky Webbing** was a [Turf](/wiki/Turf "Turf") Item that could be obtained by digging up the white, creep-like substance around [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") and [Spilagmites](/wiki/Spilagmite "Spilagmite") using a [Pitchfork](/wiki/Pitchfork "Pitchfork"). It stacked up to 10 and had a fuel value of 45/90 Sec. The ability to dig up Sticky Webbing has been entirely removed from the game.

The first *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")* exclusive character was **Warbucks**, who was added during the DLC's beta. He was later removed in update Rev. 307715 of the DLC's Early Access.

## Don't Starve Together [Disease](/wiki/Disease "Disease")[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/22/Diseased Grass Tuft.png/revision/latest?cb=20160522141518 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/22/Diseased Grass Tuft.png/revision/latest?cb=20160522141518 

A diseased Grass Tuft, good riddance.

 

Disease was a mechanic in *Don't Starve Together* that essentially rendered replanted plants useless. When a replanted plant was diseased, it had a timer set to 50 days. Once that timer was up, it had a 10% chance to become diseased. If the chance failed, the timer was reset to another value between 30-70 days and the process would repeat itself. If it was successful, the player's character would comment when harvesting the plants for 4-6 days to warn the player that the plant would become diseased. If it turned fully diseased, the plant's disease would begin to spread to other nearby replanted crops every 1.5-2.5 days without warning. The player could dig up the plant in its warning phase in order to manually reset the timer (or at the very least if the plant was already diseased, the player could dig it up to prevent the disease from spreading, but the diseased plant was destroyed in the process).

It affected Grass Tufts, Saplings, Berry Bushes, and Stone Fruit. Logs and Grass Geckos were also intended to be diseased, but never made the cut.

It was removed from the game in the *[Reap What You Sow](/wiki/Reap_What_You_Sow "Reap What You Sow")* Update.[[1]](#cite_note-1)

## Cave's Walls[]

The Caves used to have giant walls, making it hard for the player to see. They were later removed.
In game files, unused wall textures can still be found. One of them is the wooden walls that were used for the Forbidden Knowledge short and as walls for the house in the Hamlet DLC.

The **Fishing Net** was added in one of the beta updates of *[Return of Them](/wiki/Return_of_Them "Return of Them")* and could even be crafted at one point. It can still be spawned in the console with the spawn code "fishingnet". It allows the player to retrieve items that are floating in the sea at a distance. By right-clicking on an item in the sea, the player throws the net and pulls it back in order to get the item. If the player tries to catch a [Bird](/wiki/Birds "Birds"), opening the net will allow the bird to simply fly away. The player can also retrieve several items at a time.
The item can also remain in the player's hand if it breaks. Characters only have a sideways animation for using this item. In the game, the network only has a model in-hand; it does not have a model for lying on the floor or when the characters are thrown or pulled back by the net. It has an unfinished model for when the player opens the net. Despite all this, the completed animations and models can be found in the game's files.

## https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b0/Don%27t Starve Together icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20150127043033 Server intention[]

This is a feature where players can add intent to a server to tell other players about the intent of the game on that server(Social/Cooperative/Competitive/Madness). When it was removed, a similar feature was added to the [World Customization](/wiki/World_Customization_Don%27t_Starve_Together "World Customization Don't Starve Together") presets.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang") and [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") are the only characters able to survive the Deadly Feast as they can increase their maximum health after acquiring it. This is because the Deadly Feast's code only checks for a character's max health when it is first acquired.
  + [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") can also survive the Deadly Feast, as he cannot lose or gain health from eating food.
* "Long pig" or "long pork" is a term reportedly used by cannibals to refer to human flesh as food.
* [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") can turn into Werepigs if fed 4 Long Pig, since Long Pig and all variants reduce health when eaten.
* Long Pig is missing a drying model when put on a [Drying Rack](/wiki/Drying_Rack "Drying Rack").
