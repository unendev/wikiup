In DST, Maxwell's Sanity increases by 6.75 Sanity/min. He starts the game with 6 Nightmare Fuel and a [Codex Umbra](/wiki/Codex_Umbra "Codex Umbra"). He can also craft [Magician's Top Hat](/wiki/Magician%27s_Top_Hat "Magician's Top Hat") and [Magician's Chest](/wiki/Magician%27s_Chest "Magician's Chest"), both of which, alongside [Shadow Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester"), share the same storage of 12 items (4 by 3) so that if you put a rabbit into Shadow Chester, you can pull it out of the hat or chest (or vice-versa). Note that there are two separate shadow storage areas: one for the Surface and one for the Caves.

Maxwell does not suffer sanity drain from shadow items - [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword"), [Night Armor](/wiki/Night_Armor "Night Armor"), [Dreadstone Armor](/wiki/Dreadstone_Armor "Dreadstone Armor"), [Dreadstone Helm](/wiki/Dreadstone_Helm "Dreadstone Helm"), [Magician's Top Hat](/wiki/Magician%27s_Top_Hat "Magician's Top Hat").

Shadow Puppet (9 KB)

[Shadow Worker](/wiki/Shadow_Puppet "Shadow Puppet")

Shadow Puppet (7 KB)

[Shadow Duelist](/wiki/Shadow_Puppet "Shadow Puppet")

[Shadow Sneak](/wiki/Shadow_Traps "Shadow Traps")

With the Codex Umbra, Maxwell is able to summon Shadow Servants and Duelists, Shadow Sneak, and Shadow Prison. Each cast that summons a shadow servant or duelist costs him 15% of his maximum sanity and 5% durability of Codex Umbra. Codex Umbra can be refueled with Nightmare Fuel for 25% power per fuel used.

Shadow Servants can harvest trees, rocks, dig graves, and give items to the player from their one slot inventory from items on the ground or harvested from plants, and if the player can't hold the item the shadow servant tries to give, then it drops it on the ground near the player.

Shadow Duelists will fight enemies, dealing 20-60 damage depending on the equipment the player is wearing. They also teleport like Shadow Creatures when taking damage. When first approaching an enemy, they will dash for an extra 20-30 damage (based on the damage increase from certain equipment), before teleporting away. After the dash, they will then run up to the target and hit them once before blocking for about 3 seconds. During which, the shadow takes less damage up to 15 from a Treeguard, (unknown damage % reduction, as of yet) total damage taken, based on how long the shadow has blocked (the less time they've blocked, the less damage they take). After the block finishes, then the shadow strikes again and the process repeats.

Shadow Sneak can transform [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit"), [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman"), and [Splumonkeys](/wiki/Splumonkey "Splumonkey") into their Nightmare variants regardless of Sanity, and cause about 15 seconds of fear, like from fire or [Wigfrid's songs](/wiki/Battle_Songs "Battle Songs"), during which you can freely hit the enemy without fear of getting hit. This has no effect on bosses and mini bosses, such as [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops") and [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard").

Shadow Prison can be used to trap enemies in place in the area shown, trapping all creatures in the area in shadowy prisons, including bosses. The duration of Shadow Prison is reduced for larger creatures and will trigger aggro to Maxwell.

## Shadow Tiers[]

Maxwell's Shadow Duelists will get boosted damage based on the equipment worn/held which is split into 4 tiers of damage buffs.

## Prototype Tips[]

* Summoning multiple Puppets to reduce the maximum Sanity is a good way to get Maxwell to stay almost insane for long periods of time, which is not easily obtained normally due to his Sanity regain buff.
  + Going insane during [Daylight](/wiki/Day "Day") and killing [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures") for Nightmare Fuel is a good way to keep his Puppets up 24/7 during the early days of the game. Killing [Beardlings](/wiki/Beardlings "Beardlings") is also an option but Nightmare Fuel from them is not always guaranteed, unless Maxwell has used Shadow Sneak on them.
* Since Maxwell has a natural regeneration of Sanity, players are recommended to do sanity-consuming things that other players would suffer from. For example: picking [Evil Flowers](/wiki/Flower#Evil_Flower "Flower"), using [Magic](/wiki/Magic "Magic") and [Ancient](/wiki/Ancient "Ancient") [Items](/wiki/Items "Items"), or eating sanity draining [Food](/wiki/Food "Food").
  + Sanity regenerating items such as the [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter"), [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent"), [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy") etc. are unnecessary for Maxwell. This allows him to wear armor such as the [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet") while still rapidly regaining Sanity. This also makes exploring during the [Night](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle") or in [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") and [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") ideal as the Sanity drain from darkness is negated.
* While Shadow Puppets are great against weaker foes, fighting stronger Mobs will result in their death unless they're helped by Maxwell. Great support weapons are the [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff") and [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff"). The Ice Staff can be used to stun enemies before they land a hit on the Puppets, preventing them from taking damage. The Fire Staff can stun mobs for longer while also damaging them but comes at the cost of possibly burning the dropped loot upon the enemy's death.
  + Players can also take advantage of the behavior of [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") to get the most out of the Puppets. (e.g. Getting a [Tallbird](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird") to aggro on Maxwell first, then ordering the Puppets to attack it.)
* Codex Umbra grants Maxwell several ways of **obtaining Nightmare Fuel**:
  + The most reliable way of obtaining the fuel is by collecting Rabbits into an enclosed area roughly the size of Shadow Sneak and, once there are between 60 and 80 rabbits inside, casting Shadow Sneak on them and culling them during their sleep in the night.
    - This method will spawn a Krampus once or twice and will result in about 80-100 nightmare fuel during a single night. However, it requires the player to collect rabbits beforehand and takes several days to prepare. If the method is used properly, no other method of collecting nightmare fuel is necessary to collect it.
    - It is advised to set the base near a bunch of Rabbit Holes to effortlessly stack them.
  + By using Shadow Prison, and quickly afterwards Shadow Sneak on a group of [Splumonkeys](/wiki/Splumonkey "Splumonkey") or Shadow Splumonkeys and then killing them, Maxwell can obtain heaps of Nightmare Fuel, since Shadow Sneak will guarantee one to drop from each.
* Thanks to his Sanity regeneration, Maxwell will not lose Sanity even with 100 [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") while holding wet [Items](/wiki/Items "Items").

## Trivia[]

* Shadow Prison can trap [Night Hands](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") when they appear at the sanity threshold, causing them to be stunned for the entire duration of the night.
