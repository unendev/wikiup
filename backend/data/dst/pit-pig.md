The **Pit Pig** is an aggressive [Mob](/wiki/Mob "Mob") found within
*[The Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge")* event in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. They are the first creature encountered in The Forge and are also the weakest. They are a small, red-furred pigs with spikes coming out of their nostrils and a spiked helmet on their head. They walk on all fours, as opposed to The Forge's boars, which are bipedal.

Pit Pigs have two attacks: an upward swipe which only hits player in very close proximity to it, and a forward lunge, which hits players in a line ahead of it. Like all creatures in The Forge, their drops are dependent on what round it is, as well as what Forge-specific items have already been dropped. Pit Pigs also apparently appear to have some massive amount of aggro on whatever player; so much so that they will very rarely drop it, so playing as a kiter like Wes and this increases fourfold (in theory). Pit Pigs in Rounds 5, 6, and 10 will come with [Crocommanders](/wiki/Crocommander "Crocommander"); these Pit Pigs will defend the Crocommander against the player who has gained aggro on the Crocommander.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The Pit Pig's spawn code is `"boaron"`. However, it's impossible to spawn Pit Pigs in the regular game, while the [Console](/wiki/Console "Console") is not available on *The Forge* servers.
  + According to *Rhymes with Play* # 167, this name was based off of the word "baron", after its helmet.
* According to *Rhymes with Play* # 167, the Pit Pig's original design was based off of a reskinned [Hound](/wiki/Hound "Hound").
