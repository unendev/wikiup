Dragonfly is one of the four [Giants](/wiki/Giants "Giants") in the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* DLC, representing the season of [Summer](/wiki/Seasons/Summer "Seasons/Summer"). She is a large [monster](/wiki/Monster "Monster") with both reptilian and insectoid traits. When killed, Dragonfly will drop [Scales](/wiki/Scales "Scales") and 8 [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat").

* [7 Gallery](#Gallery)

## Behavior[]

In *Reign of Giants*, Dragonfly will spawn in Summer and remain neutral for as long as she is not attacked or approached. Her default flight speed is faster than a player's default speed without modifiers. While neutral, she will spit lava on various objects, turning them to [Ashes](/wiki/Ashes "Ashes") which she will then eat. After Dragonfly has consumed 20 or more Ashes, she will fall asleep unless the player is nearby.

When attacked or when the player gets too close, Dragonfly will enter her "enraged mode" and follow the player while lighting everything in her path on [Fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire"). She will follow the player through wormholes. This mode lasts for a while until Dragonfly either loses interest or her attacker is dead. During [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain"), this mode has a shorter duration. If [frozen](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff"), Dragonfly will immediately return to her calm state once she thaws (barring player proximity). When frozen, she will thaw very quickly.

When Dragonfly gets in range of her target, she will use a swipe attack while moving forward. When contact has been made, she will slam the ground three times, creating a ring of fire with each impact. This attack will set objects on fire, causing massive AoE damage.

When hit, Dragonfly will enrage and perform a large "ring of fire" AOE attack after squeaking. Any [Campfires](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") or [Endothermic Fires](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire "Endothermic Fire") caught in the attack will be fueled up and [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") will be set on fire. When enraged, she will engulf herself in flames and deal constant fire damage to anything nearby while also setting flammable objects on fire.

## Strategy[]

### General Tips[]

* When fighting Dragonfly using melee weapons, a [Tentacle Spike](/wiki/Tentacle_Spike "Tentacle Spike") or better is recommended as well as two [Football Helmets](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet") and two [Log Suits](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit"), as her AoE ground slam can deal enough damage to instantly kill certain characters without armor.
* A very cold [Thermal Stone](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone") will likely be needed to avoid [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating"). An Endothermic Fire or [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box") nearby is also recommended.
* Dragonfly takes 4 [Sleep Darts](/wiki/Sleep_Dart "Sleep Dart") to be put to sleep. Notably, although it does no damage, Dragonfly can be stunned when hit by the [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff").
* When frozen, Dragonfly will thaw very quickly, making it ineffective to rely on freezing for the sake of immobilization. However, freezing still can be used to calm her down.
* Dragonfly is able to be "barricaded" behind two structures and fought relatively safely. The gap must be large enough for the player to walk through but small enough that a [Koalefant](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant") can't. This will allow the player to strike her while still avoiding all of her attacks, though an additional speed bonus may be required.
  + Anything naturally-occurring that isn't flammable (e.g. two [Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder")) will work well, or the player can use two Campfires/Endothermic Fires (campfire or pit) as these cannot be destroyed.
  + Note that she only requires a small change of angle to free herself, so players must be careful while using this method.
* Dragonfly's swipe cannot be dodged unless the player has at least a 75% speed boost, as she does not pause before attacking.
  + [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") can fight Dragonfly head-on and avoid taking melee damage when combining the speed effects of a [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane"), SYSTEM OVERLOAD, and naturally occurring [Roads](/wiki/Road "Road") or placed [Cobblestones](/wiki/Cobblestones "Cobblestones").
  + After dodging her swipe attack, the player can safely land three strikes before her next attack, taking only minimal fire damage when efficiently switching between their primary weapon and Walking Cane.

### Methods[]

* The player should begin the fight by attacking Dragonfly once before retreating to avoid the ring of fire attack. She will be enraged and switch her first attack to her swipe. Then, the player can follow the steps below:
  + Approach Dragonfly to strike twice (while blocking her strike)
  + Move away slightly to reset the fire damage
  + Strike twice more before retreating again to avoid her AoE.
  + If timed correctly, the player can land 4 strikes and only be hit by the swipe attack, with minimal damage from burning.
* Dragonfly can easily be defeated by 28 [Blow Darts](/wiki/Blow_Darts "Blow Darts"). Additionally, using either a Blow Dart or Ice Staff will coax her into stomping, giving the player time to get away after swinging at her with melee weapons.
* One of the easiest ways to take care of Dragonfly (as with most other mobs) is to ignite a pile of [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder") after putting her to sleep. 14 Gunpowder will result in an instant kill, and due to her fireproof qualities the loot will not be damaged. A [Pan Flute](/wiki/Pan_Flute "Pan Flute") can be used for the sleep effect, or a player can coax her into consuming 20 ashes.
* The Old Bell can be used twice to weaken Dragonfly, leaving her with 750 health points. Placing three or four piles of Ashes on the ground and ringing the Old Bell as Dragonfly comes for them is a very effective way to get her to stay put as Bigfoot approaches.
* Any type of monster with large amounts of health seems to be able to fight Dragonfly and deal noticeable damage. However, this approach does not work with [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard"), due to their weakness to fire.
* [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") and [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig"), despite their success against other threats, are no match for Dragonfly, and will be killed very quickly with her AoE attack.
  + [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm") fare a bit better than Pigs due to their speed, and [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacles "Tentacles") attack quicker and deal more damage compared to Beefalo. Therefore, luring Dragonfly into a Swamp may allow its inhabitants to weaken, or distract Dragonfly.
  + While these Mobs may not be able to defeat her, when Dragonfly kills a hostile mob, she will go back to her calm state, allowing players to escape.

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, Dragonfly is no longer tied to Summer. Instead, she is present year-round as part of a special set piece in the [Desert](/wiki/Desert "Desert"). Upon death, she will also drop all types of [Gems](/wiki/Gems "Gems"), [Gold Nuggets](/wiki/Gold_Nugget "Gold Nugget"), [Lavae Egg](/wiki/Lavae_Egg "Lavae Egg")(s), a blueprint for a [Scaled Furnace](/wiki/Scaled_Furnace "Scaled Furnace"), and a [Sketch](/wiki/Sketch "Sketch") for a [Dragonfly Figure](/wiki/Chess_Pieces#Dragonfly_Figure "Chess Pieces") in addition to Meat and Scales.

Dragonfly also increases her freezing threshold by two each time she is frozen, and has four added to the threshold when enraged.

Dragonfly's year-round presence makes her an effective but dangerous way to get rid of other giants. On the other hand, due to Dragonfly's year-round presence, utilizing the other Giants strength to heavily damage Dragonfly is a viable strategy.

If Dragonfly is attacked by a nearby enemy and any player is nearby, Dragonfly will target them after killing the enemy that attacked her, even if the player is not fighting her in any way.

### Behavior[]

Dragonfly will always spawn [Lavae](/wiki/Lavae "Lavae") when reaching 80%, 50% and 20% of her Max HP. However, if all the larvae die before reaching the next thresholds, she may spawn more. Lavae are spawned from the Magma pools within range (approximately 13 pitchforks) of Dragonfly when she attempts to spawn them. The order is random and she will often revisit pools. If no pools are within range she will spawn them where she is.

The number of Lavae spawned is 5 during the first wave, and increases by one for each subsequent wave. The rate at which they spawn will also increase and Dragonfly will eventually start spawning two in quick succession from certain pools. When the last Lavae of a wave either dies or is frozen, the Dragonfly will act in one of two ways. If the last Lavae spawned was killed (or frozen) before it could die naturally (30 seconds after being spawned), Dragonfly will become enraged. If it dies naturally, after living a full 30 seconds, Dragonfly will randomly either become enraged or fly off to spawn another wave.

When in her enraged state, Dragonfly will be "extinguished" and revert back to normal after 1 minute or if her [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") is increased to 90/100. This can be achieved by throwing [Water Balloons](/wiki/Water_Balloon "Water Balloon") at her. A total of 5 balloons are sufficient to extinguish her, though targeting her while she is moving is rather difficult due to her high speed in her enraged state. This also encourages players to fight Dragonfly during [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring") when there is heavy [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") as it will naturally add to her wetness. A [Pan Flute](/wiki/Pan_Flute "Pan Flute") can also be used to revert her back to her normal state when played in range.

When fought, she will be stunned for ten seconds if she takes more than 1250 damage within a five-second period. While stunned, if she takes 2500 damage, she will drop [Scales](/wiki/Scales "Scales"). Afterwards, She cannot be stunned for another 60 seconds and requires an extra 250 damage to be stunned again (stacking each time). Subsequent stuns will not drop extra Scales, though this can be reset if Dragonfly is re-spawned by leaving the arena or killing her.

If Dragonfly is killed, she will re-spawn 20 days later (with the default World Generation setting for Dragonfly, 10 days if setting is "more", and 5 days for "lots", 40 days for "less"). If the player leaves Dragonfly's arena (approximately 16 pitchfork tiles from the center Magma pool), Dragonfly will fly away and re-spawn after 16 seconds at full health. If the dragonfly is frozen, put to sleep, or teleported, the center of the "arena" will move to where this happened. This means the dragonfly will not fly away unless moved another 16 pitchforks from this new location. She will still fly away after a short period of time if not in combat.

### Strategy[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/20/Dflywall.png/revision/latest?cb=20210108202432 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/20/Dflywall.png/revision/latest?cb=20210108202432 

Example of a wall built for use in Dragonfly fight

 

An easy way to kill Dragonfly is to build walls around the [Magma](/wiki/Magma "Magma") pools to prevent any Lavae from coming out. The player can either create walls around the Magma pools themselves or build a wall going through the furthest Magma pool with no other Magma pools on either side of it. The latter option requires less resources, but can allow openings for Lavae to get through if done wrong. If using the latter method and Dragonfly chooses to spawn Lavae at the walled Magma pool, the Lavae will spawn past the walls. If the player opts to simply tank Dragonfly's damage, they can forgo the walls around the pools and instead build a small enclosure around their character to keep out the Lavae.

When Dragonfly goes to spawn Lavae, they will go for any players nearby but won't be able to pass the walls. The player can use this time to heal or to chase her and fight. Eventually, the Lavae will die while stuck on the walls and Dragonfly will become enraged. When this happens, she can be immediately put to sleep with the Pan Flute and avoid this more dangerous phase entirely. Note that if the Lavae die naturally, there is a chance of Dragonfly flying off to spawn another wave of Lavae immediately. If avoiding this is desired, freezing the last-spawned Lavae with an Ice Staff (or killing it) will ensure she gets enraged. Thus, if the last Lavae of every wave is killed this way, players can ensure that the Dragonfly won’t spawn more than three Lavae waves

If the Pan Flute is unavailable, Dragonfly is also susceptible to Sleep Darts. While 4 Sleep Darts are enough to put her to sleep, it is recommended to shoot 5 in case one of them misses. The darts should be fired once Dragonfly begins to stomp and as soon as the player is outside of the attack's range. Trying to walk farther away than necessary will only waste time.

When kiting Dragonfly, it may be useful to use a [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane") and [Cobblestones](/wiki/Cobblestones "Cobblestones") for the added speed boost, though these are only to make the fight easier and are not absolutely mandatory. Dragonfly should be hit exactly as many times as possible before being hit (typically around 6 hits). If this is done correctly, Dragonfly will stand still while swiping and the player will be safely out of reach. If the player attempts to play it safe and hit her too little, however, she will be able to fly towards the player while swinging and land a guaranteed hit.

24 [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder") can be used to stun Dragonfly and make her drop scales, using one stack of 8 and one stack of 16. For convenience, the Dragonfly may be put to sleep (as she is immune to fire damage, she will not be woken early if she falls asleep on burning Gunpowder). Alternatively, some armor or a tamed beefalo can be used to tank a few hits to keep Dragonfly in place, though the latter necessitates a [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff") to light the Gunpowder, as well as careful maneuvering to avoid getting caught in the explosion.

## Trivia[]

* The name Dragonfly is a compound of the words "Dragon" and "Fly" rather than being based off of real life dragonflies, hence her appearance.
  + Wolfgang's quote references that fact.
  + Additionally, her *Don't Starve Together* spoils of Gold Nuggets and Gems may be due to the tales of mythical dragons hoarding large amounts of treasure.
* Dragonfly's method of melting flammable objects to consume the ashes is similar to how real flies will spit out digestive juices onto their food before sucking it up.
* Dragonfly's attack pattern resets when re-loading the game, causing her to use her AoE ground slam attack.
* In the credits for *Don't Starve Together*, Dragonfly has red eyes when not enraged, despite the in-game Dragonfly having black eyes while not enraged. Additionally, in the trailer, she is again incorrectly shown having black eyes when enraged.
* Dragonfly's [Winter's Feast](/wiki/Winter%27s_Feast "Winter's Feast") appearance resembles [holly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly "wikipedia:Holly"), specifically a variety with yellow berries.
* Dragonfly and the [Antlion](/wiki/Antlion "Antlion") spawn in different desert biomes. Antlion's desert contains the [Oasis](/wiki/Lake "Lake") and limbed [cacti](/wiki/Cactus "Cactus"), while Dragonfly's desert has [Spiky Trees](/wiki/Spiky_Tree "Spiky Tree"), [Hound Mounds](/wiki/Hound_Mound "Hound Mound"), and round [Cacti](/wiki/Cactus "Cactus").

## Bugs[]

* Occasionally, no damage will be taken from Dragonfly's flaming aura if the player runs straight towards her after she has finished her slam. This will last until the next swipe.
* Dragonfly will follow the player or Chester if they have ashes with them. She will not attack them and will act as normal other than following the path of the player.
* Dragonfly can die from two hits of the Old Bell (instead of three).
* Dragonflies spawned via console in DST may occasionally become peaceful after taking a significant amount of damage.
