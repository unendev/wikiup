The **Whispering Grand Armor** is an unlockable [Item](/wiki/Item "Item") added in the 2018 *[The Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge")* [Event](/wiki/Events "Events"). The community needed to defeat [Rhinocebros](/wiki/Rhinocebro "Rhinocebro") N times to unlock it.

It is armor for the body cell. Protects slightly better than [Wood Armor](/wiki/Wood_Armor "Wood Armor"). The main feature of this armor is to increase the efficiency of all assistants. It improves the spiders, [Abigail](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail") and [Bernie](/wiki/Bernie "Bernie"), doubling their damage and health:

* The [Baby spiders](/wiki/Baby_spider "Baby spider") began to look like [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") in the Magma set: they acquired a fiery red color. Their behavior is similar to the [Spider Warrior](/wiki/Spider_Warrior "Spider Warrior") - they rush at the enemy, causing 18 damage;
* Abigail deals 6 area damage (was 3), gets bigger and moves faster, and has 900 health (was 450). If she dies, her flower will open a little earlier;
* Bernie gets bigger, moves faster, and has 2000 health (was 1000). Resurrects twice as fast;
