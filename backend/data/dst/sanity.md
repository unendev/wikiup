**“**I get crazy when I don't sleep.**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

 <https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/File:Music_dusk_gonecrazier.mp3> 

The sound effect that play once the threshold of insanity is crossed.

 

**Sanity** is the [Character](/wiki/Characters "Characters")'s "mental health" in *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")*. The Sanity Sanity icon, represented as a picture of a brain, is located near the character's Health Health and Hunger Hunger. Characters can gain and lose sanity in various ways. A small animated arrow appears over the Sanity icon, indicating an increase or decrease in Sanity. The size of the arrow signifies the rate of gain or loss.

As sanity decreases, the player's vision becomes shaky, over-saturated, and bright, whispers are heard, and [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") start to appear. These creatures become "physical" and aggressive and will attack the player when their sanity is below 15%. When sanity is low, the player's character covers their ears and closes their eyes while rocking back and forth, as if experiencing a bad headache.

Being alone in the wilderness will take its toll. Generally speaking, being in close proximity to [Monsters](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters"), [Darkness](/wiki/Darkness "Darkness"), [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain"), eating bad or raw [Food](/wiki/Food "Food"), or using various magic items decreases sanity; while wearing certain [clothing](/wiki/Dress "Dress"), eating [Jerky](/wiki/Jerky "Jerky") and [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") food, being near friendly [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs"), and [sleeping](/wiki/Sleeping "Sleeping") increases sanity. See the Sanity Tables below for a complete list.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Sanity was added in the *[Insanity!](/wiki/Version_History#Insanity! "Version History")* update.
* Distortion can be turned off in the Options menu, removing the blurry effect on the edges of the screen that occurs from Sanity loss. This can also boost performance on slow systems.
* In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")* DLC, when being in any [interior](/wiki/Category:Interiors "Category:Interiors"), there is no loss of sanity in Darkness.
* The sound effect that plays once full insanity is reached is a distorted version of the Dawn theme.
