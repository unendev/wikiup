The **Shadow Pieces** are a group of [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures") exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, introduced in *[A New Reign](/wiki/A_New_Reign "A New Reign")*. They are based on the [Clockwork Knight](/wiki/Clockwork_Knight "Clockwork Knight"), [Clockwork Bishop](/wiki/Clockwork_Bishop "Clockwork Bishop"), and [Clockwork Rook](/wiki/Clockwork_Rook "Clockwork Rook"). With exception of the Shadow Knight, they have attack patterns completely different from the Mobs they are based on.

They will spawn after a corresponding [Marble Sculpture](/wiki/Marble_Sculptures "Marble Sculptures") is [mined](/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe") or [Chess Piece](/wiki/Chess_Pieces "Chess Pieces") is [hammered](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer") down during a [New Moon](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle"). This will not work, if the Chess Piece is located in the cave or is made out of Moon Shard.

All Chess Pieces and Marble Sculptures within 15 units of a Shadow Piece will break and spawn their respective Shadow Pieces (even if the Chess Piece is still on the [Potter's Wheel](/wiki/Potter%27s_Wheel "Potter's Wheel")). Hence, when any inner of multiple shaking Chess Pieces is hammered, all other nearby Chess Pieces will instantly break and spawn their Shadow Pieces. This also happens if a Shadow Piece is near a non-shaking Chess Piece, at any time of day, regardless of the phase of the moon.

[Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") will notice the shaking of the sculpture if it's examined, but Shadow Pieces themselves can not be examined, which is similar to the ordinary Shadow Creatures.

They have the unique ability to level up when a different Piece of the same level as them or higher[[1]](#cite_note-1) is killed nearby. For example: If a level 1 Shadow Rook is killed, all the level 1 Knights and Bishops in the proximity will become level 2, and the same with killing a remaining level 2 for the last to become level 3.

## Brain Behavior[]

The Shadow Rook will *not* destroy structures but can damage walls. Additionally, instead of charging at the player, it will teleport right behind them and attempt a melee attack.

Instead of a ranged bolt, The Shadow Bishop will turn into a swarm of shadow bats that will damage the player that stays within their range, much like the Sporecloud from [Toadstool](/wiki/Toadstool "Toadstool").

The Shadow Knight will still attempt to do a melee attack, although its attack range is significantly longer. More effort is needed to kite these as the Shadow Knight's range is quite large, and it is significantly faster.

## Gears Mechanics[]

Shadow Pieces have three levels, each significantly stronger than the previous. The leveling up of Shadow Pieces is best illustrated with an example.

A Shadow Knight, for instance, keeps track of whether or not it has witnessed the defeat of a Shadow Rook and a Shadow Bishop. The first time that a Shadow Rook is killed within 25 units of the Knight, it will level up; the same happens the first time a Shadow Bishop is killed near it. A Shadow Piece will never level up from the death of another Shadow Piece of the same type. Consequently, to kill a Shadow Piece of level 3, which is necessary to get the Shadow Atrium, it is necessary to have at least one Piece of each type.

## Tips[]

* [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") can become scared of the Shadow Pieces (similar to how they act during dusk), seemingly when the Shadow Pieces are about to attack. The same effect happens to [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") and [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider").
* None of the Pieces can be dodged in their third phase, unless the player:
  + Has speed boosts or a [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo").
  + Teleports with [The Lazy Explorer](/wiki/The_Lazy_Explorer "The Lazy Explorer") or with [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox")'s Soul Hop.
  + Is playing [Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda") and uses a [Backstep Watch](/wiki/Backstep_Watch "Backstep Watch").
* The Shadow Rook's slow attack period allows the player to use the [Bone Armor](/wiki/Bone_Armor "Bone Armor")'s protection to block every attack if the armor is fueled, even in the third stage, allowing an easy kill if chosen as the last piece fought. (The previous kills will have dropped [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") to fuel the Bone Armor, as well.)
* The Shadow Pieces are not true shadow or nightmare creatures, as they can damage and be attacked by other mobs. They do still cost less durability when attacked with a [Glass Cutter](/wiki/Glass_Cutter "Glass Cutter").
* Killing a level 3 rook and its companions takes either 200% or 199% of a [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword"), depending on the order of killing.
* The Shadow Pieces are invulnerable as they're leveling up.
* The Shadow Pieces will despawn if they have no one to fight.
* Leading them to a big herd of Beefalos in heat will cause all of them to attack the Shadow Pieces and killing them quickly.
* Playing as [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt"), fighting Shadow Pieces in the [Marsh](/wiki/Marsh "Marsh") biome will give her an advantage due to her speed boost, the help from [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle"), [Merms](/wiki/Merms "Merms") and [Mosquitoes](/wiki/Mosquito "Mosquito"), and the abundant source of [Tentacle Spikes](/wiki/Tentacle_Spike "Tentacle Spike").

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Since Level 2 and 3 Shadow Pieces receive the "epic" tag when leveling up, they are actually considered boss mobs in the code.
  + Because they're boss mobs, when a Level 2 or Level 3 Shadow Piece is being fought, the same boss music will play as when fighting the [Ancient Guardian](/wiki/Ancient_Guardian "Ancient Guardian").

## Mosquito Bugs[]

* The Shadow Knight can become stuck/frozen if attacked by multiple enemies at once in the third phase, and will not come unstuck, leaving it an easy kill.
