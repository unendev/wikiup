Willow and her lucky Lighter.

 

She is able to craft her exclusive Willow's Lighter, a portable light source similar to a torch but with a smaller radius that can also be used to [cook](/wiki/Cooking "Cooking") [Food](/wiki/Food "Food"). It can last for 600 seconds or from cooking 100 times.

[Bernie](/wiki/Bernie "Bernie") is an additional starting item exclusive to Willow. She starts with him in her inventory, and can be crafted from the Survival tab. He can be equipped in the hand slot by Willow to provide warmth and sanity, but at the cost of durability. If he is placed on the ground and is near an insane Willow (below 15% sanity, 18/120 sanity), Bernie will become [BERNIE!](/wiki/Bernie#BERNIE.21 "Bernie") and grow to immense size. BERNIE! is able to taunt and attack most Mobs, other than Bosses. Only one BERNIE! will be active for each Willow player in the game. Any other Bernie nearby will become animate, but will not increase in size. This Bernie will attract [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") and distract them until his HP is completely depleted. In addition, this smaller Bernie can be activated and used by all insane characters, not just Willow.

Willow will not receive damage from fire, though she is still capable of taking indirect damage through overheating. Her immunity to fire damage allows her to extinguish smoldering objects without taking damage and she does so faster than other characters. When she fuels a fire, it is 50% more efficient compared to other characters (this also applies to [Night Lights](/wiki/Night_Light "Night Light")). Also, it takes longer for Willow to [Overheat](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") and she takes less damage from it. Willow only takes half as long (0.5 seconds) as other Characters (1 second) to cook food.

Close vicinity to fire will gradually restore Willow's sanity. The larger the fire, the more sanity is regained up to 11 Sanity per minute, per fire. Willow must stand close to a fire to receive the effect, but her fire immunity allows doing this safely.

She has a passive sanity multiplier making her gain sanity 10% faster (sanity over time effects, including aura, structures and equipment).

## Disadvantages[]

Willow is more susceptible to [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing"). She loses more health and sanity when cold. Winter insulating items are less effective for her and she takes less hits to become frozen by attacks. She also loses sanity 10% faster from sanity over time effects.

## Tips[]

* There is no cap to the amount of sanity/min that Willow can gain from multiple fires, so the player can drop multiple flammable items nearby ([Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), [Logs](/wiki/Logs "Logs") etc.) and then set them on fire to gain massive amounts of sanity and warmth. Note that a single stack counts as a single fire, so any items will need to be dropped separately. This is only really worth it if the player can construct an [Ice Flingomatic](/wiki/Ice_Flingomatic "Ice Flingomatic"), which can preserve the items at little cost, and a way to set the items on fire such as a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") or a [Dwarf Star](/wiki/Star_Caller%27s_Staff "Star Caller's Staff").
* Since her rework, Willow's lighter is mandatory to use her spells, while also being refuelable and potentially an aid to some weapons. Nonetheless, things like Torches, the [Miner Helmet](/wiki/Miner_Helmet "Miner Helmet") and the [Lantern](/wiki/Lantern "Lantern") will provide a much better light radius and versatility than the Lighter, with a little maintenance. However Willow's Lighter is far more efficient on resources than normal torches.
* Her resistance to Overheating can be really useful during [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer").
* Willow's low base sanity allows her to easily avoid [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature"), as she only needs to be at around 19 sanity for them to disappear.
* When paired with [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") or [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson"), Willow can make her Bernie more easily.
* When paired with a [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom"), Bernie will allow Wickerbottom to read [Books](/wiki/Books "Books") without being attacked by Shadow Creatures.
* Willow's [Favorite Food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Spicy Chili](/wiki/Spicy_Chili "Spicy Chili"), meaning that she gains 15 bonus Hunger when consuming the food.
