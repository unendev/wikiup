The **Stage** is a natural structure generated in the world of *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, added in *[A Little Drama](/wiki/A_Little_Drama_and_QOL "A Little Drama and QOL")* update. It serves to better flesh out the existing story of *Don't Starve*, as well as provide some loot via the [Briar Wolves](/wiki/Briar_Wolf "Briar Wolf") it can spawn.

The stage can be found in various parts of the world, usually in the Triple [MacTusks](/wiki/MacTusk_N%27_Son#MacTusk "MacTusk N' Son") biome or in a clearing close to the [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern"). It consists of an arch with a raised floor, surrounded by a [Lush Carpet](/wiki/Lush_Carpet "Lush Carpet") and [Mosaic Flooring](/wiki/Mosaic_Flooring "Mosaic Flooring"). Beside the stage is a poster and two [Stagehands](/wiki/Stagehand "Stagehand").

To start the main performance, the player(s) need to wear the correct [Costumes](/wiki/Costumes "Costumes") and interact with the arch. Then, shadow hands appear and control the characters themselves, playing scenes from the story.

A performance can be done with fewer players than the number of characters in the scene; this is accomplished by placing [Mannequins](/wiki/Mannequin "Mannequin") on the stage. Mannequins being used as actors must be appropriately costumed. Excess mannequins are ignored during the performance, and the one that spawns by default near the stage is not close enough to be used as an actor.

Attempting to break hand props with a [Hammer](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer") or other attacks causes shadow hands to emerge from under in response, attacking the player and inflicting 80 damage.

## Scenes[]

## Mocking Bird

Mocking Bird

[Code](/wiki/Console "Console")

|  |
| --- |
| `"charlie_heckler2"` |

When the main performance starts, Mocking Birds appear around the stage, heckling the actors.

The main performance follows the journey of a Doll. The Doll encounters various figures: a caring Blacksmith, a powerful King, a mysterious Mirror, and a Fool. A player may also play the role of a Tree, though this tree contributes nothing to the story line and simply stands in place.

If any scenes are played not according to the script or costumes are not being used at all when performing, 3 hostile [Briar Wolves](/wiki/Briar_Wolf "Briar Wolf") spawn and the stage closes, reopening after 3-6 days.

Each character appears to represent a figure in *Don't Starve'*s story: The Doll (and later Queen) seems to represent [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie"), the Blacksmith [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona"), the King [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell"), the Mirror to be ["Them"](/wiki/Them "Them") or a similar being, and finally the Fool to be [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") or another survivor. The story seems to be biased in the favor of the Doll, something pointed out by Maxwell after Act 2, Scene 1 ends.

Characters can also act out their own unique soliloquies by interacting with the arch by themselves. The soliloquy presented is decided by either the current playable character or what costume they are currently wearing. There is also a unique performance if a player wearing a Queen costume and another wearing a Blacksmith costume begin a play together.
