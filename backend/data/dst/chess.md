**“**That's my natural habitat.**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell")

The **Chess** [Biome](/wiki/Biome "Biome") is a terrain that appears in both [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") and [Survival Mode](/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode") to protect the [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing") and its [components](/wiki/Things "Things").

It can be distinguished by its [Checkerboard](/wiki/Checkerboard_Flooring "Checkerboard Flooring") and [Carpeted Flooring](/wiki/Carpeted_Flooring "Carpeted Flooring"). [Marble Trees](/wiki/Marble_Tree "Marble Tree"), [Marble Pillars](/wiki/Marble_Pillar "Marble Pillar"), [Harp Statues](/wiki/Harp_Statue "Harp Statue"), and [Maxwell Statues](/wiki/Maxwell_Statue "Maxwell Statue") can all be found in this biome, being limited but abundant sources of [Marble](/wiki/Marble "Marble"). Meanwhile, [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") are replaced by [Evil Flowers](/wiki/Flower#Evil_Flower "Flower"), which will spawn [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterfly "Butterfly") and quickly drain [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") if the player is near them. [Clockwork Knights](/wiki/Clockwork_Knight "Clockwork Knight"), [Clockwork Bishops](/wiki/Clockwork_Bishop "Clockwork Bishop"), and a [Clockwork Rook](/wiki/Clockwork_Rook "Clockwork Rook") can be found in a Chess biome as well.

In Adventure Mode, there are many variations of the Chess biome design. For example, there can be a circle with Clockwork Monsters, medium to large biomes infested with clockworks (up to about a thousand can be found), to small patches of the biome with Evil Flowers. In Survival Mode, the biome appears as the large area with Clockwork Monsters and the Wooden Thing. The Chess biome that contains the Wooden Thing in Adventure Mode lacks a Clockwork Rook, only containing two Clockwork Knights and two Clockwork Bishops.

In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, Chess biomes are more common in Survival Mode as a means to provide more [Gears](/wiki/Gears "Gears") through Clockwork Monsters to players.

## Don't Starve Together icon Don't Starve Together[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, Chess [Biomes](/wiki/Biome "Biome") might also have unmined [Marble Sculptures](/wiki/Marble_Sculptures "Marble Sculptures") and [Marble Statues](/wiki/Marble_Statues "Marble Statues").

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The Chess biome first appeared in the *[Doorway to Adventure](/wiki/Version_History#Doorway_to_Adventure "Version History")* update.
* In Chapter 5 of Adventure Mode, a Chess Biome with upwards of a thousand Clockwork Monsters can sometimes be found. Due to them being so densely packed, it's unlikely the player will be able to get through without dying. Whether or not the amount spawned resulted from a bug is currently unknown.
