A full day in-game lasts for 8 real-time minutes by default (split into sixteen 30-second segments). After this time, the day counter will increase. The day consists of 3 phases: Day, Dusk, and Night.

## Day[]

The **Day** phase is the brightest and is represented by the yellow segments of the clock in the top-right corner of the screen. The Day phase is generally the safest phase of the day and also the time when most [Animals](/wiki/Animals "Animals") are active. Most Monsters, like [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider") and [Spider Warriors](/wiki/Spider_Warrior "Spider Warrior"), sleep during the Day. Neutral and passive mobs, including [Pigmen](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs"), roam outside their [houses](/wiki/Pig_House "Pig House") until dusk. [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm"), an aggressive mob, are less active during the Day phase, and this is the only time [Red Mushrooms](/wiki/Red_Mushroom "Red Mushroom") sprout up to be picked. Crops in [Farms](/wiki/Farming "Farming") are only grown in daylight.

## Dusk[]

The **Dusk** phase is shown by red segments on the clock and is the part of the day when the sun is setting and the world becomes darker, although a [light source](/wiki/Light "Light") is not yet required. At Dusk, [Bees](/wiki/Bees "Bees"), [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterflies "Butterflies"), [Frogs](/wiki/Frog "Frog"), [Gobblers](/wiki/Gobbler "Gobbler"), Pigs/Bores, Ballphins, [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit"), and [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird") all return to their homes until morning. Spiders and [Mosquitoes](/wiki/Mosquito "Mosquito") become active at this time while [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") move closer together as a herd. Merms are much more active at Dusk than any other phase. [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") will also come out of their houses during this phase and stay out until daybreak. Pigs who are trapped outside at Dusk will panic and run around searching for light. The temperature begins to drop as well, and [Green Mushrooms](/wiki/Green_Mushroom "Green Mushroom") sprout to be picked. Dusk drains an average character's [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") by 5/minute. If harvested, [Mandrakes](/wiki/Mandrake "Mandrake") will dance around and mock the player as well as follow until the break of dawn. Elder Mandrakes will also be active and stay out until dawn.

## Night[]

Wilson at Night on Wii U version

 

The **Night** phase is represented by dark blue segments on the clock. When Night falls, the world quickly becomes completely dark and a light source is necessary. Most neutral and passive mobs still outside go to sleep on the spot. [Redbirds](/wiki/Redbird "Redbird"), [Snowbirds](/wiki/Snowbird "Snowbird"), and [Crows](/wiki/Crow "Crow") who do not take flight before night comes settle down to sleep. Most aggressive mobs continue to be active at night. A light source is required during this phase not only to see, but also because [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") will attack in complete darkness. Also, in total darkness, the character cannot interact with anything (they can still place [Campfires](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") and [Fire Pits](/wiki/Fire_Pit "Fire Pit") down, provided they aren't obstructed by terrain), and Sanity drains at a rate of 50/minute. While close to an active light source, sanity drains at 5/minute. Night is the coldest phase and the time when [Blue Mushrooms](/wiki/Blue_Mushroom "Blue Mushroom"), the rarest of the three mushrooms and a potent healing item, may be picked.

## Seasons[]

:   *Note: This section relates to [Sandbox/Survival](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode") mode only.*

The amount of daylight varies throughout the game. In mid-[Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") (starting around Day 3) the *Day* phase is more than half of the total clock, while *Night* lasts only 2 segments. In [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), *Night* is about 1/3 of the clock and *Dusk* nearly half. One complete cycle of the seasons lasts 36 days; 20 Summer and 16 Winter. Below is a chart showing the amount of each phase throughout the seasons:

Day/Night Cycle in *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")*

 

## Caves[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/7a/Overall look.png/revision/latest?cb=20150107010214 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/7a/Overall look.png/revision/latest?cb=20150107010214 

A brightly lit part of a Cave meaning it's the day phase.

 

[Caves](/wiki/Cave "Cave") have a unique Day-Night Cycle. Time doesn't pass the same as it does on the surface, but there's still a Day-Night cycle. The only way to tell which phase the Day-Night Cycle is at is from the natural shafts of light, and mushrooms that are pickable. The lighted area becomes more narrow with each phase until darkness engulfs the area at night. The player still loses sanity as if it were night despite the phase. Mob activity during the phases is the same as on the surface. Naturally, [Seasons](/wiki/Seasons "Seasons") do not impact [caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") with day length (as there is no day) or temperature. Players who are freezing from the cold warm up as soon as they go underground.

[Trees](/wiki/Trees "Trees"), [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling"), [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), and [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bushes "Berry Bushes") grow as they do on the surface, but the player is blind to the passage of time while underground. [Crops](/wiki/Farming "Farming") will only grow if they are near a light source, though they can still grow with the help of fertilizer.

In Don't Starve Together, the caves share the same day-night cycle as the surface, and are in sync with eachother. This also applies to the ruins as they exist in the same layer as the caves. All other mechanics are the same as in singleplayer.

## Ruins[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Nightmare Cycle](/wiki/Nightmare_Cycle "Nightmare Cycle")*

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/fc/Nightmare Statues.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130913180146 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/fc/Nightmare Statues.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130913180146 

Ruins during the Nightmare Phase.

 

The [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") have their own cycle called the [Nightmare Cycle](/wiki/Nightmare_Cycle "Nightmare Cycle"), with a full one being much longer than a Day-Night Cycle on the surface. As with Caves, the Ruins are still considered as being in permanent night, and mob activity abides to the night phase.

The phases in the Nightmare Cycle are signaled by the [Ancient Statues](/wiki/Ancient_Statue "Ancient Statue"), [Nightmare Lights](/wiki/Nightmare_Light "Nightmare Light"), [Splumonkeys](/wiki/Splumonkey "Splumonkey"), and [Runic Turf](/wiki/Runic_Turf "Runic Turf") changing appearance and behavior, among other things.

In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* DLC, The number of segments per phase changes drastically from the vanilla game depending on season. Also, during the full moon, the moon will give enough light to walk around. When it rains on the [Surface World](/wiki/Surface_World "Surface World"), it rains inside the Caves as well. Caves can now only partially protect the player from overheating/freezing.

In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* DLC, the number of segments per phase differs a lot from vanilla game and *Reign of Giants*. [Full moon](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle") effects are also present.

In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")* DLC, when being in any [interior](/wiki/Category:Interiors "Category:Interiors"), there is no loss of sanity in the Dusk or Night phase. The full moon effect is also present.

## Mosquito Bugs[]

* When hovering the cursor over the clock during Dusk, it will not show the number of the world the player is in.
* With the Lights Out world setting in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, Full Moon may be followed by a dusk level light, instead of complete darkness.
