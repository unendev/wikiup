Miasma is an environmental hazard that spawns around [Shadow Rifts](/wiki/Rift_Cycle "Rift Cycle"), in varying amounts increasing with the phase of the rift. Standing within the miasma will damage the player by 2 hp every 2 seconds, slow them down, as well as apply an overlay to the screen to obscure their vision.

Applying fire to the Miasma via methods such as building a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire"), [Fire Pit](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire"), or interestingly, a [Night Light](/wiki/Night_Light "Night Light"), will cause the miasma to dissipate temporarily. Walking through it with a [torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch") will also cause it to disappear as well as prevent any damage as they make contact with it. Endothermic fires do not provide the same effect. Additionally, [Desert Goggles](/wiki/Goggles "Goggles"), [Astroggles](/wiki/Astroggles "Astroggles") or the [Brightshade Helm](/wiki/Brightshade_Helm "Brightshade Helm") will nullify the slowing effect and lessen the intensity of the overlay, but will not prevent the HP depletion. On the other hand, wearing the [Void Cowl](/wiki/Void_Cowl "Void Cowl") will prevent any damage from walking in Miasma.

## Prototype Tips[]

* It is recommended to avoid the Miasma entirely, as warding it away is only a temporary measure, and one may opt to simply fight the [Fused Shadeling](/wiki/Fused_Shadeling "Fused Shadeling") that spawn from the Shadow Rift outside of the Miasma instead.
