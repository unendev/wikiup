The **Terrorclaw** is an aquatic [Shadow Creature](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") exclusive to *Don't Starve Together*, introduced in *[Return of Them](/wiki/Return_of_Them "Return of Them")*.

At low sanity (below 10%), Terrorclaws spawn in place of Terrorbeaks and Crawling Horrors for players sailing the ocean. When a player lands, all Terrorclaws following them transform into Terrorbeaks. Inversely, Terrorbeaks transform into Terrorclaws when the player boards a boat.

Terrorclaws only move in the water and teleport close to the player to attack. When attacked, they do not disappear and continue to attack the player.

Killing a Terrorclaw regenerates 15 Sanity and drops 1 Nightmare Fuel plus a 50% chance of an extra one.
