A **Marble Sprout** is a sapling exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, introduced in *[A New Reign](/wiki/A_New_Reign "A New Reign")*. It grows from a [Marble Bean](/wiki/Marble_Bean "Marble Bean"), can be dug out by [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel")/[Regal Shovel](/wiki/Regal_Shovel "Regal Shovel") and drop a Marble Bean.

A **Marble Shrub** is an object similar to a [Tree](/wiki/Tree "Tree") exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, introduced in *[A New Reign](/wiki/A_New_Reign "A New Reign")*. It grows from a Marble Sprout and requires a [Pickaxe](/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe") to mine like a [Marble Tree](/wiki/Marble_Tree "Marble Tree") or a [Petrified Tree](/wiki/Petrified_Tree "Petrified Tree").

| Size | Drops | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

There are three variants that can grow, the Round, Cubic and Pyramid.

Its growth cycle is slower than an [Evergreen](/wiki/Evergreen "Evergreen")'s. It takes 0.3125-0.625 days for a Marble Sprout (planted bean) to grow to a Stage 1 Marble Shrub, then 5-6.25 days to Stage 2 and another 5-6.25 days to Stage 3. It stays at Stage 3 for 5-6.25 days before reverting to a Stage 1 Shrub again. Growing is not affected by Seasons, but a survivor needs to be within 2-3 screens of marble during Stage 2 before Stage 3 growth can begin. A reasonable strategy for fast growth would be to plant the marble, observe on day 7, and harvest 6 days later on day 13.

## Harvesting[]

Marble shrubs are fire resistant, but can be destroyed with pickaxe or Structure-damaging features. Destroying a Stage 3 shrub takes 10 swings of a pickaxe, 7 by a mighty [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang"), 5 by a player who consumed [Honey Crystals](/wiki/Honey_Crystals "Honey Crystals"), or 4 by Wolfgang with honey crystals. A forest type [Reanimated Skeleton](/wiki/Reanimated_Skeleton "Reanimated Skeleton") attracted by a [Shadow Thurible](/wiki/Shadow_Thurible "Shadow Thurible") will serve the same purpose. 1 [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder") or 10 [Slurtle Slime](/wiki/Slurtle_Slime "Slurtle Slime") is required for exploding/harvesting a Stage 3 shrub, but such an explsion can harvest 3 or more tightly spaced shrubs at once.

The fastest and cheapest ways to harvest without any tool durability loss is to get a mob to do it.

* A [Clockwork Rook](/wiki/Clockwork_Rook "Clockwork Rook") can be taunted to make short work of a clump of marble shrubs, especially if the marble is planted in a tight hexagon shape (19, 37, or 61 beans will make a perfect hexagon with sides of 3, 4, or 5 beans respectively). Many [Damaged Rooks](/wiki/Damaged_Rook "Damaged Rook") can be found in the ruins, though the [Nightmare Lights](/wiki/Nightmare_Lights "Nightmare Lights") are hard to work around. If no rook exists on the [Surface World](/wiki/Surface_World "Surface World"), an assembled [Marble Sculpture](/wiki/Marble_Sculptures "Marble Sculptures") may be mined during a [Full Moon](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle") to produce a rook. A [Chess Piece](/wiki/Chess_Pieces "Chess Pieces") rook can be crafted to replace it to spawn the [Shadow Pieces](/wiki/Shadow_Pieces "Shadow Pieces") during a new moon, but [Chess Pieces](/wiki/Chess_Pieces "Chess Pieces") cannot be hammered during the Full Moon to produce [Clockwork Monsters](/wiki/Clockwork_Monsters "Clockwork Monsters").
* [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt") can befriend [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm") to mine Marble Shrubs for her.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Marble Shrubs were added in the *[Cute Fuzzy Animals](/wiki/A_New_Reign#November_3,_2016_-_Cute_Fuzzy_Animals "A New Reign")* update.
* [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell") and [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox")'s quotes for the Marble Shrub are a reference to *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*.
