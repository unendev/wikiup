## Angeline and other members of Warly's family[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a5/Taste of Home Still1.png/revision/latest?cb=20190725220228 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a5/Taste of Home Still1.png/revision/latest?cb=20190725220228 

Angeline with her son in *Taste of Home*.

 

**Maman Angeline** is [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly")'s mother. She first appeared in the animated short *[Taste of Home](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Taste_of_Home "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/d/d1/Wall Gramaphone.png/revision/latest?cb=20230706140619 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/d/d1/Wall Gramaphone.png/revision/latest?cb=20230706140619 

Promotional image for Warly's debut and *Taste of Home*.

 

Warly's [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium") entry explains that as she got older, Angeline started losing her memory. Because of this, Warly abandoned his career as a sous chef in Paris to take care of her.

It is implied in a promotional image for *Taste of Home* that she taught a young Warly how to fish.

Warly has several [examination quotes](/wiki/Warly_quotes "Warly quotes") in *Don't Starve Together* mentioning Angeline:

* Iridescent Gem- "It glimmers like maman's eyes."
* Anchor Figure- "I think Maman would like this."
* End Table (wilted)- "I hope Maman Angeline is eating well without me."
* Codex Umbra- "Maman used to keep a journal, before her memory went."
* Plum Pudding- "Just like maman used to make."
* Celestial Altar- "You know how to get me home to maman?"
* Gestalt- "Can you... get me home to dear Maman?"
* Soprano Shell Bell- "Maman had a lovely seashell collection."

Warly also mentions his **Nana** in two quotes. The first is for [Seafood Gumbo](/wiki/Seafood_Gumbo "Seafood Gumbo") in *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* and *Don't Starve Together*: "Incredible! Just like Nana used to make!" The other is for Shark Fin Soup in *Shipwrecked*: "I used Nana's secret recipe."

Other members of **Warly's family** are pictured in the promotional image for *Taste of Home*, including who is likely **Warly's father** as well as several silhouetted figures.

## "Another of your kind"[]

During *[The Gorge](/wiki/The_Gorge "The Gorge")* event, [Mumsy](/wiki/Mumsy#Quotes "Mumsy") has a chance to say, "**Another of your kind** passed through here once."

## Charlie and Winona's parents[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/46/Charlie Family.png/revision/latest?cb=20190307202542 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/46/Charlie Family.png/revision/latest?cb=20190307202542 

Winona's family photograph in *Next of Kin*.

 

**Charlie and Winona's parents** were shown in a photograph in the animated short *[Next of Kin](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Next_of_Kin "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*.

## Misters Abernethy & Parker[]

**Misters Abernethy & Parker** - owners of a traveling circus. They invited Wolfgang to be the highlight of their circus. After a number of revelations about the power of Wolfgang, their circus was criticized. It's known that at least two clowns and two acrobats, a magician, a bear on a unicycle, a trainer with a lion, a circus elephant, trained monkeys, a strongman named Wolfgang, and possibly flamingos performed in their circus.

## Aunt Velma[]

When nearsighted, [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff") has a chance to say "Theoretically, it could be my **Aunt Velma**." This is also a reference to the *Scooby-Doo* franchise's running gag involving Velma Dinkley losing her glasses and looking for them frantically, while complaining of not being able to see without them.

## Curio Collector's family and others[]

The **[Curio Collector](/wiki/Trade_Inn "Trade Inn")'s Boss** is mentioned in a quote that may appear when idling at the Trade Inn interface: "I've always been a loner, me. Tha boss mostly lets me alone, which suits me fine."

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/11/Nox Helm.png/revision/latest?cb=20171025104144 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/11/Nox Helm.png/revision/latest?cb=20171025104144 

Nox Helm

 
 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/bf/Resplendent Nox Helm.png/revision/latest?cb=20171025154033 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/bf/Resplendent Nox Helm.png/revision/latest?cb=20171025154033 

Resplendent Nox Helm

 

Two more idle quotes involve his **nox**, one referring to his past mule, **Shadow**:

* "My wagon's pulled by a nox. 'Es a good 'un, but 'e can't hold a candle to my old mule, Shadow."
* "What's a nox? Well, I don't know as I can rightly describe it. It's kinda like an ox, but not."

The nox is also referenced in the names of two helmets in *[The Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge")* event: Nox Helm and the Resplendent Nox Helm. The word "nox" is Latin for night.

The **Curio Collector's Father** is mentioned in one of his quotes during the *[A feastin' pair of birds](/wiki/Winter%27s_Feast#A_feastin'_pair_of_birds "Winter's Feast")* minigame added during the *Don't Starve Together* Winter's Feast 2019 event: "My ol' pops taught me this game. Try to remember and match pairs."

The **Curio Collector's "mouths to feed"** were first mentioned in one of his game over quotes for the *[Ravin' Wrapper Raiders](/wiki/Trade_Inn#Ravin'_Wrapper_Raiders "Trade Inn")* minigame added during the *Don't Starve Together* [Hallowed Nights](/wiki/Hallowed_Nights "Hallowed Nights") 2019 event: "Thanks for helpin', but I can't give you a better trade. I've got mouths to feed, ya'know."

They were mentioned again in a quote for when the Curio Collector gives the player another guess for the *A feastin' pair of birds* minigame: "I've got mouths to feed. Tha birds will have to find their own feast."

## Gatekeepers[]

**Gatekeeper** is a title given to the survivors by [Battlemaster Pugna](/wiki/Battlemaster_Pugna "Battlemaster Pugna") during *[The Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge")* event. Pugna associates the Gatekeepers with serving "The Throne," referring them also as the Throne's lapdogs.

Pugna quotes introduced in the 2017 version of *The Forge*:

* Introduction- "Gatekeepers? Ha! Have you come to return us to the Throne?"
* Round 2 Banter- "Give the Gatekeepers no quarter!"
* Round 4 End / Round 5 Intro- "Know this, Gatekeepers: Once you are dead, we will activate the Gateway. We'll return to the hub and destroy the Throne. We will end this, once and for all.",
* Round 5 Banter, part 1- "The Gatekeepers must not take the Forge!"
* Round 5 Banter, part 2- "Why are the Gatekeepers still not dead?!"
* Victory- "Please. No more, Gatekeepers. We surrender."

Pugna quotes introduced in the 2018 version of *The Forge*:

* Round 7 Intro- "You have had many victories, Gatekeepers..."

In *[The Gorge](/wiki/The_Gorge "The Gorge")* event, [Mumsy](/wiki/Mumsy "Mumsy") mentions the title only once when a player is nearby during an active round. She has a chance to ask "Are you... Gatekeepers, by chance?"

## Genny and [Voxola](/wiki/Voxola "Voxola") workers[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/22/Next of Kin Winona saves Genny.png/revision/latest?cb=20190328003216 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/22/Next of Kin Winona saves Genny.png/revision/latest?cb=20190328003216

Genny and the Voxola workers watching the factory burn down.

 

**Genny** (short for **Genevieve**) and her fellow **[Voxola](/wiki/Voxola "Voxola") workers** first appeared in the animated short *[Next of Kin](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Next_of_Kin "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*. Genny is saved by Winona when a piece of the ceiling was about to fall on her. The other workers can be seen fleeing the Voxola factory after the explosion from [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff")'s portal caused a fire to break out.

Genny was was named by DST writer Kris during *Rhymes with Play* #228.

## George T. Witherstone and daughter[]

Witherstone's daughter as seen in *C'est La Vie*.

 

**George T. Witherstone** was first named in the [third William Carter puzzle](/wiki/William_Carter_Puzzles#Third_puzzle "William Carter Puzzles"). Witherstone was a dealer of Dramatic Props and Magical Apparel, who sold magician's equipment to William Carter. When William failed to pay, Witherstone had someone threaten him through a note. This action is partly what motivated William into moving out West.

His first official appearance was in the animated short *[C'est La Vie](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#C'est_La_Vie "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*, as shown by his monogram and business name on items in his apartment. The short reveals that Witherstone was about to be captured into the Constant by [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_NPC "Maxwell NPC"), but by pure happenstance was knocked out of the portal by [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes"). This allowed him to return home to his daughter who Wes was trying to help throughout the short by retrieving a lost doll for her.

As established by the animated short, Witherstone and his daughter lived at some point in an apartment in France. There is a passport with the word "America" on his table. He also owns a [Phonograph](/wiki/Gramaphone "Gramaphone") and a photo of someone standing next to what resembles a [Shadow Watcher](/wiki/Shadow_Creature#Shadow_Watcher "Shadow Creature").

He was mentioned in the newspaper article for the train crash that William Carter was involved in and is described as a "local businessman and railway investor".

## Jack Carter and other family[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/7a/Jack Carter.png/revision/latest?cb=20200320155701 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/7a/Jack Carter.png/revision/latest?cb=20200320155701 

Jack Carter in *Wish You Were Here*.

 

**Jack Carter** was first named in the [William Carter Puzzles](/wiki/William_Carter_Puzzles "William Carter Puzzles"). He is the brother of William Carter, as well as the father of [Wendy](/wiki/Wendy "Wendy") and [Abigail Carter](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail").

A postcard he sent to William is featured in the [third William Carter Puzzle](/wiki/William_Carter_Puzzles#Third_puzzle "William Carter Puzzles"). It's shown through this postcard that before William moved to America, Jack immigrated there first and decided to move out West to California before the brothers had any chance to meet in New York City. In the [fourth William Carter Puzzle](/wiki/William_Carter_Puzzles#Fourth_puzzle "William Carter Puzzles") there is a postcard addressed to Jack from William. It shows that at the time the postcard was written, Jack lived in Corona, CA.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/63/Jack Carter Post Card.png/revision/latest?cb=20210314081103 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/63/Jack Carter Post Card.png/revision/latest?cb=20210314081103 

Jack Carter's Post Card

 

Jack appeared for the first time in the animated short *[Wish You Were Here](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Wish_You_Were_Here "Animated Shorts and Trailers")* where it's revealed that he looks nearly identical to William, implying that they are also twins. After Wendy's refresh update, Maxwell was given his first [quote](/wiki/Maxwell_quotes "Maxwell quotes") mentioning his brother for the final stage of [Abigail's Flower](/wiki/Abigail%27s_Flower "Abigail's Flower"): "...I wonder how my brother is doing."

**Jack and William Carter's Mother** was first mentioned in the [third William Carter Puzzle](/wiki/William_Carter_Puzzles#Third_puzzle "William Carter Puzzles"). In Jack's postcard to William, he says: "Have you corresponded with mother lately? The post is dreadfully inconsistent out here, I can't believe she hasn't met the twins yet!"

**Abigail and Wendy's Mother**, and most likely Jack Carter's wife, is mentioned only in [Wendy's examination quotes](/wiki/Wendy_quotes "Wendy quotes").

Wendy associates her mother with the color yellow in two quotes. The first is for the [Yellow Gem](/wiki/Gem/Yellow "Gem/Yellow") ("It reminds me of my mother!"). The second is for the [Yellow Moonlens](/wiki/Moonlens "Moonlens") in *Don't Starve Together* ("What color were mother's eyes?"). This also hints that her Mother’s eyes are yellow.

The 2019 *[Winter's Feast](/wiki/Winter%27s_Feast "Winter's Feast")* event added two more Wendy quotes about her mother and cooking. The first is for eating Holiday Cheer ("Abigail, it's like I can taste mother's cooking..."), and the second is for the Sweet Potato Casserole ("Oh Abigail, remember how mother would make this every year?").

## Professor Mourire[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/9/9d/Wendy%27s Nightstand Loading Screen.png/revision/latest?cb=20200504062710 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/9/9d/Wendy%27s Nightstand Loading Screen.png/revision/latest?cb=20200504062710 

Wendy's Nightstand Vignette.

 

**Professor Mourire** is a spirit medium whose advertisement is seen in an image of Wendy's nightstand that was originally posted with her character update in *Don't Starve Together* and was later made into a [Vignette](/wiki/Vignettes "Vignettes"). Wendy became interested in spiritualists like Professor Mourire and others after the death of Abigail.

The name Mourire may come from the French verb "mourir" which means "to die." The name can also be split into two other French words: "Mou" and "rire", which means "soft" and "laugh" respectively.

## Shadow Wilson[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/c0/Unnamed-0.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150104224706 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/c0/Unnamed-0.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150104224706
