[Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") is generally considered the toughest of all the [RoG](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants") seasons, but with a little practice, you'll master surviving them in no time.

## Changes in Summer[]

* The temperature will rise dramatically, which can result in [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating").
* Sudden [Fires](/wiki/Fire "Fire") might break out.
* Plants will die quickly, and will require more fertilizer.
* Summer has the longest days and the shortest evenings.

## Preparation[]

If you can, go into the caves. Although in Don't Starve RoG you will overheat, wildfires will not start (in DST, overheating will not be an issue, and like in RoG, wildfires will not start). Though spelunking carries its own, albeit, easily managed, challenges.

Summer starts on day 21 if your world started in Spring, or day 56 if it's your fourth season. Getting prepared will be a lot more difficult if starting in Spring. For beginners, it is advised to start in Autumn as the extra seasons to prepare for Summer are valuable.

You will need plenty of [Cut Stone](/wiki/Cut_Stone "Cut Stone"), [Gold](/wiki/Gold "Gold"), [Gears](/wiki/Gears "Gears"), [Nitre](/wiki/Nitre "Nitre"), [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice") and [Cut Grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass") to start preparations. Start by building an [Endothermic Fire Pit](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire_Pit "Endothermic Fire Pit") close to your original [Fire Pit](/wiki/Fire_Pit "Fire Pit") if there is enough room. This will require [Nitre](/wiki/Nitre "Nitre"), [Cut Stone](/wiki/Cut_Stone "Cut Stone") and [Electrical Doodads](/wiki/Electrical_Doodad "Electrical Doodad"). This essentially functions as a regular Fire Pit, except that it will keep you cool instead of warm, the light will have a blue tint, and you cannot cook food on it.

Next, you will want an [Ice Flingomatic](/wiki/Ice_Flingomatic "Ice Flingomatic"). This useful device flings ice at fires and plants, fertilizing them automatically. It has a limited range, so you may need two or three if you have a large base. This will help put out wildfires caused in Summer. Be warned, it will also put out [Campfires](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") or Fire Pits, so place it a safe distance from your Fire Pit.

To make an Ice Flingomatic requires 2 Gears, 2 Electrical Doodads and 15 Ice. It is best to gather Ice during winter, as [Mini Glaciers](/wiki/Mini_Glacier "Mini Glacier") melt shortly after Spring begins.

Food isn't as much an issue in Summer as it is in Winter. Farms will still function, and Berry Bushes will grow back, provided you fertilize them. [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit") start running again after Spring ends.

You will also want a [Thermal Stone](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone"). This will lower your temperature if it's frozen. To freeze it, either place it on the ground by a lit Endothermic Fire, or place it in an [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box"). Certain clothing items will also help keep your temperature at bay, such as the [Eyebrella](/wiki/Eyebrella "Eyebrella") and [Umbrella](/wiki/Umbrella "Umbrella"). There are also items like the [Fashion Melon](/wiki/Fashion_Melon "Fashion Melon") and [Ice Cube](/wiki/Ice_Cube "Ice Cube"), but these will increase your [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness"), which effectively lowers your temperature at the cost of [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity").

## The First 5 Days[]

The first few days of Summer are alright. The days won't be as long as they could be, you won't Overheat as quickly as in mid-summer, and the first 2 days have no wildfires. Remember to use your Endothermic Fire Pit instead of your regular one. The temperature doesn't lower much during the night, and you will overheat if you stand by a normal fire.

After Spring, rabbit holes will open up again. This allows them to be used as a food source once more. Place [Traps](/wiki/Trap "Trap") in front of their holes to capture them for food.

Just as you should always keep materials for a Fire with you during Winter, always keep the materials for an Endothermic Fire with you during Summer (AKA grass and nitre). Remember that food can't be cooked on an Endothermic Fire, however, normal fires and [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") will work as normal.

## Late Summer[]

The days will be getting longer and hotter by this time. You might even get a visit by the [Dragonfly](/wiki/Dragonfly "Dragonfly") if playing Don't Starve, not Don't Starve Together. I recommend not fighting her unless you're feeling confident.

Most likely, all you want to do by now is just sit at your base and wait the rest of the season out. If you have enough food and resources to sustain yourself for a few days, go for it by all means. If you haven't already, you should consider building a [Siesta Lean-To](/wiki/Siesta_Lean-To "Siesta Lean-To") with [Boards](/wiki/Boards "Boards") Grass and [Silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk") to avoid overheating and restore sanity and [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") in the process.

It may also be an opportune time to head to the caves where there is no risk of overheating.

## Congratulations![]

You have survived your first summer! :D
