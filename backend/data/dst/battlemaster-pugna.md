## Placeholder Trivia[]

* During his laugh animation a small figure is knocked out from under his helmet, appearing to be a tiny action figure of Hazard, a character from *Hot Lava*, one of Klei's other games.
* Battlemaster Pugna's spawn code is `"boarlord"`. However, it's impossible to spawn Battlemaster Pugna in the regular game, while the [Console](/wiki/Console "Console") is not available at all on *The Forge* servers.
* According to *Rhymes with Play* #162, Pugna was originally from "our world", before he arrived at the Forge.
* Pugna's voice was changed multiple times during *The Forge* beta.
* His name, "pugna", is literally translated as "war" in Latin.
  + The word also carries similar connotations in certain Romance languages, such as "conflict" in Spanish, "battle" in Italian, and "struggle" in Portuguese.
