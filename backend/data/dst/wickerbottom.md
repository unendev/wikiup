## Minimap Maxwell's Door Origin[]

**“**Like any good librarian, Ms. Wickerbottom believes in the preservation and distribution of knowledge. Well… most knowledge, that is. There are some things that must be kept hidden away from the eyes of the public. Who knows what could happen if certain secrets fell into the wrong hands?**”**

–From the official Youtube description for One For the Books"

Don't Starve Together- One For the Books -Wickerbottom Animated Short-

 

**Wickerbottom**'s backstory was revealed in an animated short titled [One For the Books](https://youtu.be/15ESUxxJvZs). An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium"):

*When people meet Ms. Wickerbottom, most assume that what you see is what you get. She certainly looks every bit the typical librarian that she claims to be, as at home amongst the bookstacks as any creature in their native habitat. Nobody would raise an eyebrow at such a person being well-versed in a wide range of subjects. Who would spare a second thought if, upon further inquiry, her knowledge rivaled that of experts? And obviously, no one would think of questioning what a librarian might be involved in after hours, when the library doors are closed to the public...*

## Trivia[]

### In-Game[]

* Wickerbottom was added to *Don't Starve* in the *[Progress!](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve/Version_History#January_29,_2013_–_Progress! "Don't Starve/Version History")* update on January 29, 2013.
* Wickerbottom is played by an oboe.
* Wickerbottom's eyes are shut by default, but open sometimes, like when she exits a [Worm Hole](/wiki/Worm_Hole "Worm Hole") or is low on Sanity.
  + In DST, Wickerbottom is able to be put to sleep by a Pan Flute in PVP mode or by [Bearger](/wiki/Bearger "Bearger")'s yawn. Due to this, players are able to see that Wickerbottom sleeps with her eyes open, most likely due to her insomnia.
* While unable to sleep, Wickerbottom is still able to be knocked out by cooking a [Mandrake](/wiki/Mandrake "Mandrake") or consuming a Cooked Mandrake.
* Wickerbottom has a [skull](/wiki/Unimplemented_Features#Player_Skulls "Unimplemented Features") in the game files.
* Wickerbottom's previous perk, before the *Strange New Powers* update, was to be able to prototype one tier higher than the other Characters, including Magic Items.
* When struck by Lightning in DLCs, Wickerbottom, like most other Characters, is shown to have bones in her hair. In addition to this, she also has bones in her skirt and shoes.
* Wickerbottom was the only female playable Character to have pupils and black, beady eyes, before Winona's release.

### Lore[]

* Wickerbottom's first name is unknown.
* Wickerbottom is fond of seafood, judging from her [examination quotes](/wiki/Wickerbottom_quotes "Wickerbottom quotes") for various fish dishes and her favorite food.
* [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") believes that Wickerbottom has, or at least used to have, a pet cat. When Wickerbottom examines the [Lucky Cat Jar](/wiki/Lucky_Cat_Jar "Lucky Cat Jar"), she sighs, and when she examines a [Kittykit](/wiki/Critters#Kittykit "Critters"), she says "Now it feels like home.", which provides further evidence to this. This is also later confirmed in her animated short, *One For the Books.*
* When examining her book *Birds of the World*, she says that the Western screech owl is her favorite. This is also the particular bird species in *[The Screecher](/wiki/The_Screecher "The Screecher")*.
* She is the most literate of the *Don't Starve* characters and always refers to animals by their scientific names. The only exceptions to this are the creatures that are completely unknown to her. This can provide information as to what creatures in the [Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant") exist in her homeworld.
* She kept a garden at home, according to her quotes for a Potted Succulent ("I wonder how my garden is doing without me.") and Bloomfin Tuna ("Oh my, you'd look right at home in my old garden.").
* She is the only character to wear unremovable glasses.
* Wickerbottom's [loading screen vignette](/wiki/Vignettes "Vignettes") from *The Forge* is accompanied by text that reveals a bit of her love of books: *Delightfully, Ms. Wickerbottom has found her passion for the written word has only deepened as the years go by. Any knowledge committed to paper becomes impervious to the brain fogs of age, you know!*
* Her comment about Sammy's Wagon in *[The Gorge](/wiki/The_Gorge "The Gorge")* event ("Reminds me of my bookmobile days.") reveals that she used to own and operate a [bookmobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmobile "wikipedia:Bookmobile").
* During *Rhymes With Play* #229, a larger version of Winona's pegboard from her animated short *Next of Kin* was shown. It revealed a previously obscured missing poster of Wickerbottom in the bottom right corner, connected to a newspaper clipping on the burning of a New York library.
* Wickerbottom's birthday is listed as December 6 in the [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium").
* Sometimes a message like this may appear during the loading screen in DST: "Wickerbottom is of the firm belief that the pen is mightier than the sword. Words hold great power when used correctly."

### Cultural References[]

* Wickerbottom's Snowfallen skin could be a twofold reference to the titular Snow Queen from the Hans Christian Andersen story and to the White Witch from *The Chronicles of Narnia*. Her quote for the skin ("Would you like a sweetie, dear?"), may be a further reference to the White Witch due to an event in one of the books where she tricks a main character into eating a magical Turkish delight.
