## Perks[]

In DST, Wigfrid has all the abilities from *Don't Starve* alongside additional abilities exclusive to DST.

Wigfrid is now able to eat food items classified as "goodies", such as [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy"), [Jellybeans](/wiki/Jellybeans "Jellybeans"), and [Volt Goat Chaud-Froid](/wiki/Volt_Goat_Chaud-Froid "Volt Goat Chaud-Froid"), not counting special event food.

She gains Health and Sanity from attacking mobs based on the damage before the 25% bonus (instead of killing), `Health & sanity gain = Mob's damage × 0.25 × (original damage ÷ Mob's Health)`.
For example, if she attacks a [Spider](/wiki/Spider "Spider") with the Battle Spear, she gains 2.125 Health and Sanity per hit (20 × 0.25 × (42.5 ÷ 100) = 2.125).

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b9/Inspiration Meter.png/revision/latest?cb=20200924201621 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b9/Inspiration Meter.png/revision/latest?cb=20200924201621 

Full inspiration meter.

 

Wigfrid has a unique Inspiration meter, which allows her to perform her [Battle Songs](/wiki/Battle_Songs "Battle Songs"). Wigfrid's Inspiration level rises when fighting foes, giving up to 2.4 Inspiration points for every 100 damage inflicted. Fighting [bosses](/wiki/Category:Boss_Monsters "Category:Boss Monsters") grants triple that amount, up to 7.2 Inspiration for every 100 points of damage. The amount of gained Inspiration lowers depending on the current amount of Inspiration, scaling down the higher the current Inspiration percentage is.

`Inspiration gain = damage × 0.024 × (1 - current percentage of inspiration) (×3 if Boss)`

It is important to note that the `damage` variable in the above equation is the actual damage inflicted. This means that all damage modifiers such as her own 25% damage bonus, Volt Goat Chaud-Froid, [spicy foods](/wiki/Chili_Flakes "Chili Flakes") or even damage reduction from enemies will affect the amount of inspiration she gains.

Wigfrid also gains Inspiration when receiving damage from mobs

`Inspiration gain = health loss × 0.024 × (1 - percentage of inspiration)`

After 7.5 seconds without gaining Inspiration, Wigfrid loses 2 Inspiration every second.

Wigfrid has exclusive access to the [Stagecraft Tab](/wiki/Stagecraft_Tab "Stagecraft Tab") to craft the Battle Songs. She can sing up to 3 Battle Songs at a time (unlocked at 16.6, 50 and 83.3 Inspiration respectively) to apply various buffs to her and all surrounding players. Each battle song remains active until the Inspiration falls below the corresponding unlock threshold.
There are five battle songs:

* The [Weaponized Warble](/wiki/Weaponized_Warble "Weaponized Warble") makes weapons drain durability 25% slower, or 0.75× the normal rate.
* The [Heartrending Ballad](/wiki/Heartrending_Ballad "Heartrending Ballad") provides +1 Health per hit for all other players nearby, while Wigfrid players gain additional +0.5 Health per hit.
* The [Clear Minded Cadenza](/wiki/Clear_Minded_Cadenza "Clear Minded Cadenza") provides +1 Sanity for nearby players for each hit they land on enemies.
* The [Bel Canto of Courage](/wiki/Bel_Canto_of_Courage "Bel Canto of Courage") reduces sanity drain by half for nearby players.
* The [Fireproof Falsetto](/wiki/Fireproof_Falsetto "Fireproof Falsetto") provides a 33% decrease in fire damage.

There are also two instant Battle Songs that apply a one-time effect at the cost of 16.6 Inspiration:

* The [Rude Interlude](/wiki/Rude_Interlude "Rude Interlude") focuses nearby enemies' attention on Wigfrid.
* The [Startling Soliloquy](/wiki/Startling_Soliloquy "Startling Soliloquy") startles nearby enemies, sending them into a state of panic for 4 seconds.

Neither of these effects impact [bosses](/wiki/Category:Boss_Monsters "Category:Boss Monsters").

## Tips[]

* Wigfrid can eat all Meat type foods, even those that are not entirely meat, such as meatballs. [Eggs](/wiki/Eggs "Eggs") are an animal product and thus count as meat.
* Wigfrid's diet can be detrimental in a few ways:
  1. She is unable to fully take advantage of beneficial food, such as [Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries"), [Carrots](/wiki/Carrots "Carrots") and [Butterfly Wings](/wiki/Butterfly_Wings "Butterfly Wings") during early exploration, [Green Mushrooms](/wiki/Green_Mushroom "Green Mushroom") and [Cooked Cacti Flesh](/wiki/Cooked_Cactus_Flesh "Cooked Cactus Flesh") for Sanity management.
     + Once a Crock Pot is crafted she can use these foods as filler.
  2. Her options using a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") become limited, as she misses out on some useful recipes like [Dragonpie](/wiki/Dragonpie "Dragonpie") and [Butter Muffin](/wiki/Butter_Muffin "Butter Muffin"),
* Carrying Meat while exploring [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") can be dangerous, because it will automatically trigger [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") to attack, though this can be avoided by storing Meat items in [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester") or [Hutch](/wiki/Hutch "Hutch").
* As a temporary measure, eating [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") can be used as a means of survival, especially since she can regain lost Health and Sanity from killing mobs.
* [Farm Plants](/wiki/Farm_Plant "Farm Plant") and some other structures can still be beneficial to Wigfrid. Crops from Farms can make good filler and are sometimes essential in some Meat-based recipes. [Carrots](/wiki/Carrots "Carrots") can be used to befriend [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnymen "Bunnymen"). [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bushes "Berry Bushes") can be used to hunt [Gobblers](/wiki/Gobbler "Gobbler"). [Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries") can be used as filler or turned into [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure")/[Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot") for easy fire fuel. A [Bird Cage](/wiki/Bird_Cage "Bird Cage") can be used to turn rotting meat into [Eggs](/wiki/Egg "Egg"). Honey from [Bee Boxes](/wiki/Bee_Box "Bee Box") can be used to make [Honey Ham](/wiki/Honey_Ham "Honey Ham") and [Honey Nuggets](/wiki/Honey_Nuggets "Honey Nuggets") or [Honey Poultice](/wiki/Honey_Poultice "Honey Poultice"). [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") can be used to bait [Bird Traps](/wiki/Bird_Trap "Bird Trap").
* A base/camp near a [Sinkhole](/wiki/Sinkhole "Sinkhole") allows Wigfrid to kill the [Batilisks](/wiki/Batilisk "Batilisk") that spawn at [Dusk](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle") for some easy Health and Sanity.
  + A base/camp near [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Dens "Spider Dens") can be used in a similar way. This will also provide a lot of monster meat, which can be cooked and fed to an imprisoned bird in a Bird Cage to obtain eggs.
* [Meatballs](/wiki/Meatballs "Meatballs") may be the best Crock Pot dish for Wigfrid, as it's the most cost effective Hunger-wise.
* Wigfrid's Battle Helm and Battle Spear are stronger (and cheaper to make) than the [Spear](/wiki/Spear "Spear") and [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet"). Her items will be outclassed by [Ham Bats](/wiki/Ham_Bat "Ham Bat"), [Shelmets](/wiki/Shelmet "Shelmet") and anything better though.
* A [Pig Village](/wiki/Pig_Village "Pig Village") can be a good resource for Meat early in the game, and it's possible to kill the Pigs with little to no trouble. This can be further improved by feeding the pigs four (4) Monster Meats, which will transform them into [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig") (resulting in more [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") and [Pig Skin](/wiki/Pig_Skin "Pig Skin")).
* During the early days of the game, it can be a good idea to keep a pet [Catcoon](/wiki/Catcoon "Catcoon") and use it to get the aggro of [Koalefants](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant") for easy meat.
* [Pig Villages](/wiki/Pig_Village "Pig Village"), [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") and [Ponds](/wiki/Pond "Pond") are some of the best food sources for Wigfrid.
* Players should try to find the [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King") for infinite amounts of [Gold Nuggets](/wiki/Gold_Nugget "Gold Nugget") for Wigfrid’s gear.
* Wigfrid's [Favorite Food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Turkey Dinner](/wiki/Turkey_Dinner "Turkey Dinner"), meaning she gains 15 bonus Hunger when eating it.
* Wigfrid can attack [Slurtles](/wiki/Slurtle "Slurtle") while they are in their shells using a hambat or walking cane to safely regenerate her health and sanity.
