Building radius is the minimum [distance](/wiki/Distance "Distance") which buildings or plants can be placed.

## Don't Starve Together r617515 and later[]

This applies to Don't Starve Together versions from 28 June 2024.

Buildings and plants have their building radius group

1m - [Sapling](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling"), [Grass Tuft](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft"), [Walls](/wiki/Wall "Wall"), [Crops](/wiki/Farm_Plant "Farm Plant")

1.5m - [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box"), [End Table](/wiki/Stagehand#End_Table "Stagehand"), [Sign](/wiki/Sign "Sign")

2m - [Alchemy Engine](/wiki/Alchemy_Engine "Alchemy Engine"), [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot"), [Lureplant](/wiki/Lureplant "Lureplant"), [Stone Fruit Bush](/wiki/Stone_Fruit_Bush "Stone Fruit Bush")

2.5m - [Ice Flingomatic](/wiki/Ice_Flingomatic "Ice Flingomatic")

3.2m - [Pig House](/wiki/Pig_House "Pig House")

When placing buildings from the same building radius group, their respective building radius applies. However, when mixing building from different building radius groups, their average is taken as the building radius. For instance, When placing a Sapling beside an Ice Flingomatic, the Sapling has to be at least 1.75m, instead of the shorter 1m, from the Ice Flingomatic. Conversely, the Ice Flingomatic only needs to be at least 1.75m, instead of of the longer 2.5m, from a Sapling.

## Prior to Don't Starve Together r617515[]

This applies to Don't Starve single player and Don't Starve Together versions before 28 June 2024.

Most buildings have a bigger building radius of 3.2m while plants remains mostly at 1m or 2m.

When placing the building or plant, they check for their respective building radius. This can result in buildings requiring bigger building, building of bigger building radius, to be unplaceable if they are placed later. Smaller building, building of smaller radius, would first have to be removed to make the bigger building placeable. The smaller building can then be replaced after the bigger builder has been placed.
