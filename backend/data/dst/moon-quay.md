**Moon Quay** also known as **Moon Quay Island** is a *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* exclusive feature and was introduced in *[The Curse of Moon Quay](/wiki/The_Curse_of_Moon_Quay "The Curse of Moon Quay")* update. It is a small, remote island located far out into the [Ocean](/wiki/Ocean "Ocean"). The main land is covered with [Moon Quay Beach Turf](/wiki/Moon_Quay_Beach_Turf "Moon Quay Beach Turf") with extensions made of [Docks](/wiki/Docks "Docks").

The island's docks are home to [Powder Monkeys](/wiki/Powder_Monkey "Powder Monkey") spawning from their [Monkey Huts](/wiki/Monkey_Hut "Monkey Hut"). [Cannons](/wiki/Cannon "Cannon") also appear on the docks and will be used by the monkeys when aggressive. Around the docks empty [Pirate Sloops](/wiki/Pirate_Sloop "Pirate Sloop") can be found.

The mainland is home to the [Queen of Moon Quay](/wiki/Queen_of_Moon_Quay "Queen of Moon Quay") surrounded by [Monkey Bars](/wiki/Monkey_Bar "Monkey Bar"). Nearby the queen is also the [Unnatural Portal](/wiki/Unnatural_Portal "Unnatural Portal") that sits on a dock-filled area. The portal occasionally spits out various items, primarily those related to [mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") and resources unique to the island.

Vegetation on the mainland includes [Palmcone Trees](/wiki/Palmcone_Tree "Palmcone Tree"), [Banana Bushes](/wiki/Banana_Bush "Banana Bush") and [Monkeytails](/wiki/Monkeytails "Monkeytails"). [Crustashines](/wiki/Crustashine "Crustashine") are a mob that roam the area and provide an amount of light at night.

Other items included on the island are [Pirate Banners](/wiki/Moon_Quay_Pirate_Banner "Moon Quay Pirate Banner") and pieces of [Broken Machinery](/wiki/Broken_Machinery "Broken Machinery") which can be hammered down for [Gears](/wiki/Gears "Gears"), [Cut Stone](/wiki/Cut_Stone "Cut Stone"), and [Frazzled Wires](/wiki/Trinkets "Trinkets").

## Tips[]

* Bring rot to fertilize banana transplants (or bring [Bananas](/wiki/Banana "Banana") from the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins")). Bananas are the only way to get rid of [Accursed Trinkets](/wiki/Accursed_Trinket "Accursed Trinket") and turn from [Wonkey](/wiki/Wonkey "Wonkey") back to the character's original form. They take several days to ripen, so plant and fertilize about a dozen of them from the [Unnatural Portal](/wiki/Unnatural_Portal "Unnatural Portal").
  + Monkeys will harvest ripe bananas very quickly and bring them to the Queen, taking them out of play - buildinga Fence around the banana bush will prevent monkeys from picking them.
* Monkeys steal the leftmost items in a player's inventory, one at a time, excluding the trinkets, so keeping a stack of cheap items in that slot will prevent irreparable loses.
* Expect a [Pirate Raid](/wiki/Pirate_Raid "Pirate Raid") on approach and every 5 days or so thereafter while boating within 200 tiles.
* Monkeys sleep at night. Plan landing times accordingly.
* One monkey can be separated from a group (for killing it without aggroing other monkeys) by dropping a trail of items, each about 3 tiles apart.
* Burn or hammer [Monkey Huts](/wiki/Monkey_Hut "Monkey Hut") to stop more monkeys from spawning. Hammer the burnt huts for [Boards](/wiki/Boards "Boards"). Note that once you set fire to the hut, a monkey will immediately exit and attack you similar to [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm") behaviour.
* Wall off the [Unnatural Portal](/wiki/Unnatural_Portal "Unnatural Portal") with stone walls and a [Wood Gate](/wiki/Wood_Gate "Wood Gate") to keep the occasional monkey that spawns contained, but allow entry for retrieving items. Other walls can be used, but cut stone is plentiful from hammering [Broken Machinery](/wiki/Broken_Machinery "Broken Machinery") and mobs like [Pengulls](/wiki/Pengull "Pengull") and [Hounds](/wiki/Hound "Hound") can be hard on walls.
  + Consider planting a [Lureplant](/wiki/Lureplant "Lureplant") which will attack monkey and collect loot automatically. Remember to change the tiles from wood so [Eyeplants](/wiki/Lureplant "Lureplant") will spawn.
* Read each blueprint immediately as the [Queen of Moon Quay](/wiki/Queen_of_Moon_Quay "Queen of Moon Quay") provides it in exchange a banana. Otherwise, she gives copies of the same blueprint over and over.
* The [Monkey Bars](/wiki/Monkey_Bar "Monkey Bar") surrounding the Queen of Moon Quay provide constant light. The queen herself is a small source of shade and 20% rain protection (like a tree).

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The island with its dock extensions is generated to look like a head with wild hair (or a skull with dreadlocks), possibly resembling [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff") who appears to be responsible for the portal and thus the occupants of the island.
* The name is a pun on "monkey", the primary inhabitants of the island.
