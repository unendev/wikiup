**“**Ugh. I don't think I should eat that.**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

**Monster Foods** are [Food](/wiki/Food "Food") [Items](/wiki/Items "Items") which have a monster food value, meaning they will create [Monster Lasagna](/wiki/Monster_Lasagna "Monster Lasagna") when more than one is used in a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot"), except when [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs") are added as an ingredient or another recipe with higher [priority](/wiki/Crock_Pot#Priority "Crock Pot") matches the ingredients used.

Monster Foods are typically poisonous and cause damage to [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") and [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") when eaten; however, these effects can be lessened by [cooking](/wiki/Cooking "Cooking") them. [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") does not suffer the Health and Sanity penalty when eating any Monster Foods. Eating 4 Monster Meats of any type, such as Monster Lasagna, will also cause [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") to be transformed into [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepigs "Werepigs"). There are 2 basic Monster Food items in-game (3 in the Shipwrecked DLC).

Because Monster Meat, Cooked Monster Meat, and Monster Jerky are considered [Meat](/wiki/Category:Meats "Category:Meats") and Durian and Extra Smelly Durian [Fruit](/wiki/Category:Fruits "Category:Fruits"), putting only one in a Crock Pot to cook will create a normal dish, depending on the other ingredients used. Jellyfish and all of its associated products are considered [fish](/wiki/Category:Fishes "Category:Fishes") as their secondary type. Using Monster Meat in this way renders it safe to eat.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* There was another Monster Food called [Deadly Feast](/wiki/Deadly_Feast "Deadly Feast"). It has since been removed from the game, but it is still available to spawn by using its [DebugSpawn code](/wiki/Console "Console"). Eating it will instantly bring the character's health to 0, though it acts like a regular Monster Food for Pigs.
* Jellyfish is unique among monster food as it does not deduct health or sanity from the player, even if eaten raw. It however, still counts as monster food in Crock Pot definitions.
* Adding 2 or more Monster Food items into a Crock Pot will usualy result in Monster Lasagna, because of its high priority. But when cooking [Surf 'n' Turf](/wiki/Surf_%27n%27_Turf "Surf 'n' Turf") (https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/46/Shipwrecked icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20151205104708) there is no limit to how many Monster Food Items can be added, this because of that the Surf 'n' Turf takes priority over Monster Lasagna. This allows the player to use 3 Monster Food Items in a Crock Pot while making Surf 'n' Turf. Altough only 2 of these can be Monster Meat, because of the recipes restrictions.
