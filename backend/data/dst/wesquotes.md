## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Wes will still say "I can't do that" when attempting to do an impossible action (this is corrected in Don't Starve Together icon).
* Wes's original pantomime movements were animated by Alex Savin.[[1]](#cite_note-1)
* During the preview stream for *[A Little Rain Must Fall](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve/Version_History#March_12th.2C_2013_-_A_Little_Rain_Must_Fall "Don't Starve/Version History")*, developers said that Wes has an invisible bicycle, a likely reference to his cycling action.[[2]](#cite_note-2)
* Additional pantomimes were added to DST for Wes's [refresh update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History#April_1.2C_2021_-_Wes_Character_Update "Don't Starve Together/Version History").
* According to *Rhymes with Play* #279, the pantomime in which Wes waves both his hands is based on the American Sign Language (ASL) sign for applause.
* The pantomime in which Wes puts a hand to his forehead and looks around is recycled from an animation for the [Crabby Hermit](/wiki/Crabby_Hermit "Crabby Hermit") Don't Starve Together icon.
* Wes is the only character without an actual quote
* In *Don't Starve Together*'s *[A Little Drama and QOL](/wiki/A_Little_Drama_and_QOL "A Little Drama and QOL")* update, the game files include dialogue strings for Wes's soliloquy. These are never seen normally in-game since he is coded never to access dialogue strings. The text is in French, and translates to "Are you trying to understand my thoughts? How kind of you! I am flattered. :)"
