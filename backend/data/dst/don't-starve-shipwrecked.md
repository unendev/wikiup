## Official Description[]

*Klei Entertainment has partnered with our friends at CAPY, creators of Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery, Super Time Force and Below; to bring fans of Don’t Starve the latest single-player expansion: Don’t Starve: Shipwrecked!*

*In Don't Starve: Shipwrecked, Wilson finds himself stranded in a tropical archipelago. He must learn to survive all over again in this new environment filled with new biomes, seasons, and creatures.*

*Don’t let the tropical breeze lull you into a false sense of security - the world might be different, but it is still equal parts unforgiving and uncompromising. You will quickly find these islands are full to the brim with things that want to kill you.*

*Key Features*

* *Navigate the Open Ocean: Craft a boat and set sail for adventure!*
* *Explore an Entirely New World: The entire world is different. Explore new biomes filled with new resources. Scavenge for new sources of food. Run for your life from a host of new creatures.*
* *Brave New Seasons: A set of tropically inspired seasons will try their hardest to kill you.*
* *Craft New Recipes: Build an array of new gadgets to help yourself survive these harsh islands.*

*Shipwrecked* adds a tropical standalone world to the basegame. The ocean was completely reworked to create a new biome accessible by boats. The other features of this DLC include:

## Reign of Giants Content from *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")*[]

Since *Shipwrecked* is the second DLC released for *Don't Starve*, it relies on several mechanics that were originally featured in the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* DLC. Therefore these mechanics (and items/structures that are needed to deal with them) had to be included in *Shipwrecked* and are now also available to players who do not actually own *Reign of Giants*. These changes also affect default *Don't Starve* worlds that have been made compatible with or linked to *Shipwrecked* worlds.

Please note that this category is not meant to include *Reign of Giants* exclusive features that are indeed available in *Shipwrecked* worlds, but only to players who own both DLCs, such as the characters [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") and [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber").

Note: If your worlds have already gone out of sync, they will remain out of sync, but won't get any worse. This will prevent issues such as:   + Entering the caves in one season and coming back in another.   + Volcano taking ages to load.   + All your food rotting in your pockets when you travel between worlds.   + And of course, the clocks getting out of sync! * Backpack Inventory nesting bug fixed in Shipwrecked * Placed items that are guaranteed won't spawn unless needed (Warly's cookpot) * Time of day effects (e.g. darkness) will sync properly when travelling between worlds. * Floral Shirts now require cactus flowers in ROG and vanilla worlds whether they are shipwrecked compatible or not. * Willow won’t be frozen by the flingomatic now, like the other characters. * Beardlords won’t occasionally drop regular bunnyman loot now * Shark Tooth Crown will now perish when its durability is lost * Fix getting stuck on a black screen occasionally when loading a game. This happens because the character died for some reason, so save games suffering from this will either be concluded or end up at a resurrection stone/statue. * When you die in a merged or teleportato'd world, you get XP based on the character age, not the world age. * Terraformed beach tiles will now be tideable. * Planted turf will now block tide so long as it’s dry. * Caves and Volcanoes are merged over as well when merging a Survival world with a Shipwrecked world. * Survival worlds now correctly retain their RoG or Vanilla season data when merging with a Shipwrecked world. * Fixes a save file corruption caused by inventory stack sizes that go below one.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* On September 3, 2015, *Shipwrecked* was revealed to be planned as a stand-alone game in an official *[Rhymes with Play](http://www.twitch.tv/kleientertainment/v/14291463)* stream. However, after much feedback from fans, it was decided that it would become a DLC instead. This would allow players to keep their progress as well as let them travel between regular *Don't Starve* and *Reign of Giants* worlds and new *Shipwrecked* worlds.[[3]](#cite_note-3) However this is not the case on the mobile version as they are 2 separate apps, meaning Webber and Wigfrid are not playable on the mobile version of *Shipwrecked*.
* A special structure, the [Sunken Boat](/wiki/Sunken_Boat "Sunken Boat") with a parrot named Wolly sitting on top of it, was added to the original game in the July 30, 2015 update. By solving [Wolly's Riddle](/wiki/Wolly%27s_Riddle "Wolly's Riddle"), the announcement of *Shipwrecked* was revealed.
* In some pre-release builds, being on a boat would drain the player's [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity").
