**“**Mmm...Smells good!**”**

–**Wormwood**

**Wormwood** is one of three [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") introduced in the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC. He appears to be an animate plant, akin to [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard"), though he has a green cut stone on the front of his chest. Wormwood is friendly while a little eccentric, addressing things such as insects as "Bzzters" and birds as "Tweeters."

On June 6, 2019, Wormwood was added to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* as the second DLC character after [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox").[[1]](#cite_note-1)[[2]](#cite_note-2)[[3]](#cite_note-wormwoodlive-3) He is available to *Hamlet* owners on Steam for free. For all other players, Wormwood can be purchased either through the Wormwood Chest, which includes his Roseate skin set, or through the Wormwood Deluxe Chest, which includes the Roseate, Oasis Bound and Hollow skin sets. He can alternatively be woven with 2,700 [Spools](/wiki/Spools "Spools").

## Special mechanics[]

Wormwood has many unique abilities pertaining to [Plants](/wiki/Plants "Plants") and plant-like [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs"), and he has access to unique crafting recipes that can help with healing and defense. He is able to plant [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") without the use of a [Farm](/wiki/Farm "Farm"), and he is treated neutrally by Mobs such as the [Lureplant](/wiki/Lureplant "Lureplant") and [Snaptooth Flytrap](/wiki/Snaptooth_Flytrap "Snaptooth Flytrap"). He also seems to have some sort of kinship with plants, addressing most of them as "Friend," or things similar. Because of this, he loses Sanity when plants around him die, and he gains Sanity when he himself plants them.

Wormwood loses Sanity when plants within a five-tile radius are destroyed, even if the damage is not caused by him. Sanity effects from planting or destroying plants is reduced the further it happens from Wormwood.

* -2 Sanity from burned trees, flowers, seeds, saplings and grass tufts. Saplings, grass tufts, and tree seeds will cause sanity loss even if burned as an item on the ground. The amount of items in the stack does not change the sanity drain.
* -2 Sanity from trees, saplings or grass tufts being knocked over or uprooted by things.
* -5 Sanity from picking [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") or digging up tree stumps, Grass Tufts, Saplings.
* -15 Sanity from chopping down a tree at any growth tier. *In Hamlet*: Includes burned trees. *In DST:* Does not include burned trees.
* +10 Sanity from planting a tree or sapling.

Wormwood does not restore or lose Health from eating [Food](/wiki/Food "Food"). He gains and loses normal amounts of Sanity and Hunger from food, however. Health can still be restored using Healing items such as [Spider Gland](/wiki/Spider_Gland "Spider Gland"). (Both *Hamlet* and *DST*)

### Bloom[]

In both *Hamlet* and *DST*, Wormwood has a "bloom" mechanic. Please check the respective DLC pages (link on top of this page) for the actual mechanic.[[4]](#cite_note-4)[[5]](#cite_note-5)

### Fertilizing[]

Wormwood can "fertilize" himself with fertilizer items to gain Health or Bloom speedup; see [Nutrient](/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient") for an in-depth explanation of his fertilizer mechanics.

## Minimap Maxwell's Door Origin[]

**“**Though the circumstances of his creation were unusual at best, Wormwood came into this world full of optimism and curiosity, ready to make new friends and see all that life had to offer. But as time wore on and he experienced the cold sting of rejection, he came to learn what the moon above had always known: Wormwood the Lonesome does not belong here.**”**

–Official description for *Lunar Roots* [[3]](#cite_note-wormwoodlive-3)

 File:Don%27t Starve Together Lunar Roots Wormwood Animated Short 

Don't Starve Together Lunar Roots Wormwood Animated Short

 

Wormwood's creation is shown in the animated short *[Lunar Roots](/wiki/Animated_shorts_and_trailers#Lunar_Roots "Animated shorts and trailers")*.

A green gem fell from the moon, landing on an ancient stone monument in the middle of overgrown rubble. Over a long period of time, a vine encircled the gem and eventually formed a humanoid figure sitting on the monument. The figure, Wormwood, opened his eyes and looked at his hands. He admired the tropical scenery, mimicking the flapping wings of the Butterflies with his leaf fingers. Trying to fit in, he imitated Parrots and Pogs, but he scared them off. Feeling downtrodden, he sat at the base of the monument and tucked himself under a nearby vine. He gave it a pat and smiled to himself. He went to sleep and bloomed along with the nearby plants while under the full moon.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

### In-Game[]

* Wormwood was introduced in the February 7, 2019 Character update during the *Hamlet* DLC's Early Access phase.[[6]](#cite_note-6)
* Wormwood's voice is a [didgeridoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didgeridoo "wikipedia:Didgeridoo").
* Wormwood's quotes use the font Henny Penny and are green in color. He is the only character to have a unique font and text color.
  + In *Don't Starve Together* the green color was replaced with white because that text color is used in the game's chat system to differentiate the players.[[7]](#cite_note-7)
* [Maxameleon](/wiki/Maxameleon "Maxameleon") has different dialogue when Wormwood is the chosen character: "Get moving, tree. Chop, chop!"
* Before he was implemented, there were files in the game of an alternate design, which most noticeably had large, curly horns on his head. In addition, the original sound files were replaced in his introductory update with a very different sound.
* Wormwood calls [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushroom "Mushroom") his friends, although Mushrooms are not plants and are fungi in real life. This is likely in reference to the highly symbiotic and common relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and plant life. The game acknowledges this distinction, and uprooting Mushrooms as Wormwood does not drain sanity.
* Wormwood is the third character from a *Don't Starve* DLC to be added to *Don't Starve Together* after [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") and [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber").
* Wormwood is the first character to receive a special idle animation in *Don't Starve Together*. In his idle animation, he mimics Butterflies with his hands, referencing the *Lunar Roots* short.
* Wormwood is one of four characters to have more than one ghost transformation with the others being [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie"), [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt"), and [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox"). He is also one of four characters to have different ghost designs for each of his skins.
* Wormwood's skull was found in the DST files as of May 6, 2021.

### Lore[]

* Wormwood, [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt"), and [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba") may be the first survivors to originate from the [Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant") and not the real world like the others.
* Wormwood's birthday is listed as June 6 in the [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium"). June 6, 2019 is the day Wormwood was added to DST.
* To the question on the forum "Is Wormwood a plant or an animal?" developer Nome replied: "While it certainly beats some alternatives, a cladistic categorization of life on earth already struggles with concepts like horizontal gene transfer - it's therefore ill-equipped to handle the effects of magic gemstones. I suggest either developing a rigorous framework for the categorization of Constant life which includes the effects of shadow and lunar influence, clockwork origins, etc, etc or just finding a way to be less hung up on labels. If you choose the former here's some starting reading <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-62446-5> "[[8]](#cite_note-8)

### Cultural References[]

* The living log crafting animation may be a reference to the scene in *[Avengers: Infinity War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:_Infinity_War "wikipedia:Avengers: Infinity War")*, where Groot chops off his arm in order to construct the handle of the Stormbreaker.
* Wormwood's name and its back story of falling from the sky may be a reference to the disaster of the third angel sounding the horn in the Book of Revelation.
