**“**A creature made of the dark fuel! I must get closer!**”**

–[Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff")

A **Shadow Creature** is a type of [Monster](/wiki/Monster "Monster") in *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")*.

Shadow Mobs that the player can fight and drop nightmare fuel when defeated:

* [Crawling Horror](/wiki/Crawling_Horror "Crawling Horror") is the most common shadow creature. It usually appears when a character first goes insane, or can spawn from [Nightmare Lights](/wiki/Nightmare_Light "Nightmare Light") and other sources.
* [Terrorbeak](/wiki/Terrorbeak "Terrorbeak") is a more dangerous form of Crawling Horror that spawns spontaneously when a characters' sanity reaches zero.
* [Wavey Jones](/wiki/Wavey_Jones "Wavey Jones") is the less dangerous aquatic shadow creature in Don't Starve Together that maliciously tinkers with boats.
* [Terrorclaw](/wiki/Terrorclaw "Terrorclaw") is the more-dangerous aquatic shadow creature in Don't Starve Together that aggressively tries to kill the character.
* [Shadow Pieces](/wiki/Shadow_Pieces "Shadow Pieces") are a sort of shadow-boss trinity in Don't Starve Together, spawned from [Marble Sculptures](/wiki/Marble_Sculptures "Marble Sculptures") or certain [Chess Pieces](/wiki/Chess_Pieces "Chess Pieces") at certain nights of the [Moon Cycle](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle").
* [Parasitic Shadeling](/wiki/Parasitic_Shadeling "Parasitic Shadeling") is a shadow creature that spawns after the [Nightmare Werepig](/wiki/Nightmare_Werepig "Nightmare Werepig") is being freed. It doesn't attack the character, but the Nightmare Werepig.
* [Swimming Horror](/wiki/Swimming_Horror "Swimming Horror") is an aquatic shadow creature in Shipwrecked

Shadow Creatures that can affect reality, but do not drop nightmare fuel

* [Night Hands](/wiki/Night_Hand "Night Hand") try to steal a log from [Campfires](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire").

Shadow Creature visual effects or spells:

* [Shadow Watcher](/wiki/Shadow_Watcher "Shadow Watcher") takes over the character's mind with [Ancient Fuelweaver](/wiki/Ancient_Fuelweaver "Ancient Fuelweaver")'s mind control attack. Other visual affects and sanity indicators are covered on this page as well.

[Shadow Aligned](/wiki/Shadow_Aligned "Shadow Aligned") creatures that are fully visible and can interact with a sane player are more substantial than the shadow creatures covered in this article:

* [Reanimated Skeletons](/wiki/Reanimated_Skeleton "Reanimated Skeleton") in Don't Starve Together
* [Fused Shadelings](/wiki/Fused_Shadeling "Fused Shadeling") in Don't Starve Together

At least one shadow-creature-like entity exists in a DLC that does not have Shadow Aligned creatures:

* [Ancient Herald](/wiki/Ancient_Herald "Ancient Herald") in *Hamlet*

Hostile Shadow Creatures have a [Sanity aura](/wiki/Sanity#Temporal_Sanity_Table "Sanity") that drains the player's Sanity Sanity at a rate of -100/min. Killing some may restore a small amount of Sanity, depending on how the creature was spawned. Most Shadow Creatures drop [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") when killed.

Shadow Creatures will spawn as nearly transparent entities when the player's Sanity drops below 82.5%. As Sanity continues to drop, a [Crawling Horror](/wiki/Crawling_Horror "Crawling Horror") can typically be seen stalking characters. As the characters' sanity decreases, the shadows become more "real" (less transparent). Most shadow creatures will attack characters who drop below 15% Sanity. More dangerous ones will spawn when the character's sanity reaches zero. In multiplayer, any shadow creatures stalking nearby players with low sanity will all begin attacking the first player to drop below 15% sanity.

The shadow creatures fully exist only in the insane character's head, so followers (other than [Bernie](/wiki/Bernie "Bernie")) do not notice or attack them. Shadow Creatures are immune to [Tooth Traps](/wiki/Tooth_Traps "Tooth Traps") and [Bee Mines](/wiki/Bee_Mines "Bee Mines"). Nearby Shadow Creatures will prevent the player from using a [Straw Roll](/wiki/Straw_Roll "Straw Roll"), [Fur Roll](/wiki/Fur_Roll "Fur Roll"), [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent"), or [Siesta Lean-to](/wiki/Siesta_Lean-to "Siesta Lean-to"). In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, players can assist those plagued by Shadow Creatures by force-attacking them (CTRL-F). However, this causes the Shadow Creature to attack and follow that player instead.

During the [Nightmare Phase](/wiki/Nightmare_Cycle#Nightmare_Phase "Nightmare Cycle"), Shadow Creatures spawn from [Nightmare Lights](/wiki/Nightmare_Light "Nightmare Light") in the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") and [Nightmare Fissures](/wiki/Nightmare_Fissure "Nightmare Fissure") in the [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves"). They're hostile, regardless of Sanity, and will pursue the player until they despawn after the Nightmare Cycle has reached the Calm Phase. Killing a Shadow Creature that has spawned from a Nightmare Light will not restore the player's Sanity.

## Fighting Strategy[]

Crawling Horrors, Terrorbeaks, and Swimming Horrors can be easily kited. When one reaches melee attack range, it will stop for an instant before biting the player. If the player dodges this bite, the shadow can be hit safely for about 2 seconds. After this hit, it teleports within 1 screen of the player. The player should "swing twice" when they attack in case the shadow's next position is right next to the player. Once the player misses, they can stop attacking until it's time to dodge again.

Shadow creatures periodically rear up on their hind legs and can be hit "for free" during this animation.

If the player knows their weapon will do enough damage to kill the shadow (the "final blow"), there is no need to dodge. Hold F, run in, and kill it.

Since shadow creatures are only visible to the player, most mobs cannot be recruited to defend against Shadow Creatures. [Willow](/wiki/Willow "Willow")'s [Bernie](/wiki/Bernie "Bernie") is the only Mob in the game able to taunt and attack Shadow Creatures.

Shadow Creatures fought in a tiny room or cramped corridor which forces the crawler to repeatedly teleport right next to the player.

The Crawling Horror allows additional [strategies](/wiki/Crawling_Horror#Fighting_Strategy "Crawling Horror"), especially in Don't Starve Together.

Handling more than one shadow creature at a time without taking a hit is certainly a challenge. Even the pros run away from 4 or more. Care should be taken when going insane at base in multiplayer because other players often return to base with low sanity and several Shadow Creatures.

### Going Insane on Demand[]

Shadow creatures can only be fought while insane (unless they spawn from [Nightmare Lights](/wiki/Nightmare_Light "Nightmare Light")). For characters who have trouble going insane ([Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell") and [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") when she's fighting), here are some free ways to lower sanity (from early-game to later game):

* Jump back and forth through [Worm Holes](/wiki/Worm_Hole "Worm Hole").
* Eat raw [Green Caps](/wiki/Green_Cap "Green Cap") (Wigfrid can't).
* Equip a [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword") and stand in the dark, then step back into the light just before [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") attacks. Repeat as necessary.
* Touch the [The Lazy Deserter](/wiki/The_Lazy_Deserter "The Lazy Deserter").

For a complete list see: [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity").

### Farming Nightmare Fuel[]

[Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") is very valuable for crafting (and refueling) many of the best items in the game. There are [several ways to acquire nightmare fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel#Gathering "Nightmare Fuel"), but once a player is comfortable kiting these creatures, going insane and fighting them becomes the most practical way to harvest this resource. Farming a stack can still be costly in terms of time and weapon durability, making a few weapons much better suited to this task:

* In Don't Starve Together, an Ornery [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") with a [War Saddle](/wiki/Saddle#War_Saddle "Saddle") is the ideal shadow fuel farming tool, but any [Beefalo Temperament/Saddle Combination](/wiki/Beefalo#Speed_vs._Damage_Trade-offs "Beefalo") that deals more than 40 damage per hit is a great choice. A beefalo in Don't Starve Together has infinite durability, offers a speed boost, takes melee damage instead of the player, and heals slowly over time from the occasional hit.
* A fresh [Ham Bat](/wiki/Ham_Bat "Ham Bat") does a high amount of damage for several days.
* In the rain, a [Morning Star](/wiki/Morning_Star "Morning Star") deals 72.25 damage against *wet* targets and loses durability based on how long it is wielded, not on how many hits it delivers. The high damage takes down shadow creatures in 5 or 6 hits, making the fight go very quickly. The very short usage time can make it economical. It also provides light. Using this on dry shadow creatures is a waste, as is keeping it weilded any longer than strictly necessary.
* The [Glass Cutter](/wiki/Glass_Cutter "Glass Cutter") deals the same damage as the [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword"), but with double the durability vs. Shadow Creatures. It makes fights go fast, but is expensive, must be crafted on [Lunar Island](/wiki/Lunar_Island "Lunar Island"), and still wears out eventually. [Moon Shards](/wiki/Moon_Shard "Moon Shard") can be slow to acquire between mining all glass boulders and fighting [Celestial Champion](/wiki/Celestial_Champion "Celestial Champion"). It's a great weapon for [Ancient Fuelweaver](/wiki/Ancient_Fuelweaver "Ancient Fuelweaver") and the Shadow Chess Pieces though.
* [Walter](/wiki/Walter "Walter")'s [Trusty Slingshot](/wiki/Trusty_Slingshot "Trusty Slingshot") allows him to simply "Hold F" to fire at the perfect rate to hit a Shadow Creature the moment it finishes teleporting. This is quick, easy, and even works well enough against 2 at once. The main problem is the cost of the ammo. [Marble](/wiki/Marble "Marble") can be farmed, but a Beefalo is forever.

Below is the number of hits it takes (with a default damage modifier) to kill Shadow Creatures. The [Weather Pain](/wiki/Weather_Pain "Weather Pain") is not included due to the random nature of its projectile.

## Downloadable Content[]

In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")* DLC, Crawling Horrors and Terrorbeaks can chase the player through [Lily Pond](/wiki/Lily_Pond "Lily Pond") [Biomes](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes"), attacking along with Swimming Horror. Also, Crawling Nightmares and Nightmarebeaks can spawn when non-Nightmarefuel items are given to the [End's Well](/wiki/Wishing_Well#End's_Well "Wishing Well"). Those spawned at End's Well are the same as in the Ruin, restoring no Sanity.

## Trivia[]

### In-Game[]

* Shadow Creatures are one of the only mobs able to freely travel through walls and are the only mobs that can freely travel across the barrier that separates land from ocean. They can only do this while not aggressive. When Sanity drops below 15%, they will manifest into a physical form, unable to perform such feats.
* Attacking a Shadow Creature will cause any other Shadow Creature to become "real" and aggressive, regardless of the Sanity level. The hostility of a Crawling Horror, Terrorbeak or Swimming Horror may end after an attack if the player's sanity is higher than 15%.
* Shadow Creatures are the only creatures that cannot be examined but can be attacked by the players.
* Although Shadow Creatures cannot be examined, there are unused examination quotes for Swimming Horrors and Mr. Skittish in the game files.
* The smoke emitted by the [Shadow Thurible](/wiki/Shadow_Thurible "Shadow Thurible") and Tragic [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch") skin in DST sometimes takes the shape of a Crawling Horror, a Terrorbeak, or a Shadow Hand.
* Wavey Jones and Terrorclaws were introduced in the *[Troubled Waters](/wiki/Return_of_Them#Troubled_Waters "Return of Them")* update.

## Codex Umbra Lore[]

* Shadow Creatures make several appearances throughout the [William Carter Puzzles](/wiki/William_Carter_Puzzles "William Carter Puzzles").
  + There is a Shadow Watcher in the source code of the fourth and the sixth puzzles. This is the only time a Shadow Watcher is pictured with an end to its body, which resembles that of a [Ghost](/wiki/Ghost "Ghost").
  + The fifth puzzle includes what appears to be a journal page documenting an encounter with a Terrorbeak, presumably by Maxwell conducting rituals with the Codex Umbra.
  + A Terrorbeak, a Crawling Horror, and a Night Hand appear in the source code of the eighth puzzle.
  + Mr. Skitts and a Terrorbeak appear briefly in an intermission animation in the eighth puzzle.
  + In the animation found in the eighth puzzle, *[The Amazing Maxwell - The Final Act](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#The_Amazing_Maxwell_-_The_Final_Act "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*, a Shadow Watcher appears on screen just before Maxwell and Charlie are grabbed by the Codex Umbra.
  + A Shadow Watcher also appears in one of the final images of the eighth puzzle where it can be seen in the ruined apartment that belonged to Maxwell.
* Several Shadow Creatures appear in the [Cyclum Puzzles](/wiki/Cyclum_Puzzles "Cyclum Puzzles") comic.
* An image of a Terrorbeak eating a small figure can be spotted on a news article in the animated short *[Next of Kin](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Next_of_Kin "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*. The headline reads "Do Evil Shadow Monsters Lurk Among Us?"
* A Terrorbeak torments young [Willow](/wiki/Willow "Willow") in *[From the Ashes](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#From_the_Ashes "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*. It is shown to be repelled by [Bernie](/wiki/Bernie "Bernie").
* Multiple instances of Shadow Hands and Terrorbeaks appear to be terrorizing [Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda") throughout the animated short *[Long Shadows](https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Long_Shadows)*.

### Cultural References[]

* Shadow Creatures are similar to the monsters in [Lovecraftian literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovecraftian_horror "wikipedia:Lovecraftian horror"); otherworldly beings that are able to move through dimensions and cause humans to suffer insanity. Their names are also allusions to Lovecraftian stories such as *The Lurking Fear* and *The Crawling Chaos*.
* [Sleep paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis "wikipedia:Sleep paralysis") victims often report seeing deformed shadowy creatures creeping around the room. Sleep paralysis is also commonly associated with [lucid dreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream "wikipedia:Lucid dream"). The description for the [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword") is "lucid dreaming damage."
* Wavey Jones' name is a reference to the phrase Davy Jones' Locker, which is a common metaphor for drowning among sailors.

## Tips[]

* In the [Reign of Giants DLC](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants"), tornadoes spawned by the [Weather Pain](/wiki/Weather_Pain "Weather Pain") may stop their teleports due to its fast and continuous attacks. It is very useful for stopping a group of Shadow Creatures during [Nightmare Cycle#Nightmare Phase](/wiki/Nightmare_Cycle "Nightmare Cycle").

## Bugs[]

* A Terrorbeak's body can disappear, with only the beak and legs visible.
* Although shadow creatures generally cannot interact with non-player creatures, the shadow creatures spawned by any creature that strikes the Ancient Pseudoscience Station will become aggressive towards it.
* In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* DLC, Crawling Horrors and Terrorbeaks can teleport to the [Ocean](/wiki/Ocean#Shipwrecked "Ocean") when hit, causing them to get stuck on the shore line, unable to get back to land. They can still be attacked next to the border, however.
* In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, if a player walks away and comes back to their camp while a night hand is reaching for it, sometimes it will stay in place until it is either chased by the player or it is destroyed by a light source.
* In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC, Swimming Horrors cannot actually teleport when attacked in the [Lily Pond](/wiki/Lily_Pond "Lily Pond") [biome](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes").
* Attack Shadow Creatures spawned from rooms of [Ancient Pig Ruins](/wiki/Ancient_Pig_Ruins "Ancient Pig Ruins"), especilly in the room of [End's Well](/wiki/Wishing_Well "Wishing Well") may cause them teleport to the oustside of room's boundaries. If player kill them in these areas, their loots will become unpickable unless uses [The Lazy Forager](/wiki/The_Lazy_Forager "The Lazy Forager").
