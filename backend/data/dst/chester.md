–[Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda")

**Chester** (short for **Otto von Chesterfield, Esquire**[[1]](#cite_note-1)) is a unique passive [mob](/wiki/Mob "Mob") that acts as a mobile [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest"). By clicking on Chester, the player can store up to nine stacks of [items](/wiki/Item "Item") inside him.

Chester will first spawn after the [Eye Bone](/wiki/Eye_Bone "Eye Bone") is placed in the player's inventory. He will then follow the Eye Bone from that point on. As long as the Eye Bone is in the player's possession, Chester will follow the player, including into Caves. If the Eye Bone is dropped on the ground or stored somewhere (even inside Chester himself), he will stop following the player and remain with the Eye Bone.

Chester regenerates [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") at a rate of 22.5 HP every 3 seconds. When killed, he drops all of the items stored inside, and the Eye Bone will close its eye. If he dies while burning, any flammable items that he was carrying will be set on fire and burnt to [Ashes](/wiki/Ashes "Ashes"). Chester will respawn in one game [day](/wiki/Day "Day"), wherever the Eye Bone happens to be.

As long as [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") is the one carrying the Eye Bone, spiders will not attack Chester. This does not apply to the [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen"), or the spiders spawned by her.

## Chester transformations[]

Chester can transform under the magic of a [Full Moon](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle") when filled with specific magic items in his 9 inventory slots. Filling all of Chester's inventory slots with at least one unit of [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") will create **Shadow Chester**, who has 3 more inventory slots bringing his inventory space to 12. Shadow Chester causes food inside him to spoil 50% faster, the same rate as if it were left on the ground. If Shadow Chester dies with items inside, the items will not be dropped. When Chester spawns as regular chester, items will not be in his inventory. However, if Chester transforms again into shadow chester, the items that were lost when he died can be found inside transformed chester. Expirable items will continue to spoil during this time.

Filling Chester instead with [Blue Gems](/wiki/Blue_Gem "Blue Gem") will turn him into **Snow Chester**. Snow Chester's ability causes food to last twice as long inside him, effectively turning Chester into a fuzzy and portable [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box"). If Chester dies, he loses his transformation and returns as normal.

## https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f8/Reign of Giants icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20140408110712 Reign of Giants[]

In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, Snow Chester does not prevent [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice") and [Ice Cubes](/wiki/Ice_Cube "Ice Cube") from melting, despite acting as a mobile Ice Box. He cools [Thermal Stones](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone") at half the speed of an Ice Box. [Spiders](/wiki/Category:Spiders "Category:Spiders") befriended by [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") will not attack Chester.

## https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b0/Don%27t Starve Together icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20150127043033 Don't Starve Together[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, if the player carrying the Eye Bone logs out or goes into [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves"), the Eye Bone will drop from their inventory. In the Caves, [Hutch](/wiki/Hutch "Hutch") can be found as a replacement for Chester.

Ice Chester will prevent Ice from melting and cool Thermal Stones at the same speed as an Ice Box.

As of the [Maxwell character refresh](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History "Don't Starve Together/Version History"), the items in Shadow Chester link to the shadow dimension, meaning that items placed inside Shadow Chester can also be accessed via the [Magician's Chest](/wiki/Magician%27s_Chest "Magician's Chest") or the [Magician's Top Hat](/wiki/Magician%27s_Top_Hat "Magician's Top Hat") and vice versa. This means that Shadow Chester can no longer hold certain items (including the Eye Bone). If Shadow Chester dies, he does not drop the contents of the shadow dimension, leaving them accessible from the Magician's Chest, the Magician's Top Hat, and a future Shadow Chester. This also means that, in absence of Maxwell's items, Shadow Chester's death renders his contents inaccessible until Chester respawns and is transformed into Shadow Chester again.

## Prototype Tips[]

* Eye Bone's location usually is close to the spawn and next to a road. Sometimes next to a cluster of frog ponds.
* Since Chester regenerates health at a fast rate, he can be a useful tool in restoring the player's health. If Chester is attacked with the [Bat Bat](/wiki/Bat_Bat "Bat Bat"), the player will regain health from the hit with no risk of being attacked but any followers will attack Chester. Chester's regeneration can be used to lure aggressive mobs like [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider") away from the player.
* It may be a good idea to keep the Eye Bone in a [Backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") so that when armor is equipped, Chester will remain near the Backpack while enemies are dealt with. However, it may backfire if Chester dies in the combat he followed the player into.
* [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") *can* steal the Eye Bone if it is in a Backpack. If Krampus despawns with the Eye Bone, it will be gone permanently.
* Chester can only transform into Shadow Chester or Snow Chester if the required materials to do so are placed inside the normal version of Chester. In other words, it is impossible for Shadow Chester to transform into Snow Chester (and vice versa).
* Chester (and [Hutch](/wiki/Hutch "Hutch")) can be easily lost when going down one sinkhole to the caves and up another, or when different players take Chester to a different part of the map. Placing a [Cratered Moonrock](/wiki/Cratered_Moonrock "Cratered Moonrock") or the [Celestial Orb](/wiki/Celestial_Orb "Celestial Orb") inside Chester (or Hutch) makes it show up on the map for all players.
* The Eye Bone can be dropped on the ground when not using Chester.
* Snow Chester cools down [Thermal Stone](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone") if placed inside, allowing the players to combat [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") during summer.
* It is possible to "store" 21 items in Chester. It is done by filling Shadow Chester, killing it, and then filling regular chester. During Full Moon, the player gains access to the items lost during Shadow Chester's death. It is especially useful during long journeys that accumulate lots of items.
* If Chester is removed via [Console commands](/wiki/Console/Commands "Console/Commands"), he will not respawn. He can be spawned again with console commands, but will not follow the Eye Bone; this can be fixed by placing the Eye Bone inside Chester and taking it back out.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Klei's Chester Plush Kickstarter Video - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd59Rvbqu0A>
* Chester was added in the *[Spoiled Rotten](/wiki/Version_History#January_15.2C_2013_.E2.80.93.C2.A0Spoiled_Rotten.5B9.5D "Version History")* update.
* Chester's name is a pun on him being a mobile chest.
* Chester is one of the few Mobs that cannot be frozen.
* [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") cannot steal from Chester. However, Chester can be killed, allowing Krampus to steal items that were stored in Chester.
* Chester cannot be healed using healing items.
* If [Fireflies](/wiki/Fireflies "Fireflies") are stored inside of Chester, he will sometimes give off a tiny amount of light.
* If one were to light an item within Chester's inventory, he will hop around in panic and ignite nearby flammable objects while providing light.
* Shadow Chester was implemented after achieving $25,000 in total pledges during [Klei's Chester Plush Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/731983185/dont-starve-chester-plush).
* Snow Chester was implemented after achieving $120,000 in total pledges during [Klei's Chester Plush Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/731983185/dont-starve-chester-plush).
* Chester is possibly a reference to the Luggage from the *[Discworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld "wikipedia:Discworld")* series, which are suitcase-like creatures similar in appearance.
* According to Wilson, Chester is an *Esq.*, which is short for [esquire](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/esquire "wiktionary:esquire"). In the United Kingdom, esquire was used to denote a member of nobility below the rank of a knight. In more recent times, it's simply used as an honorific. In modern North America, it is commonly used to denote a lawyer. It came from Old French and is literally translated as "shield-bearer".
* Before the *[All's Well That Maxwell](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve/Version_History#October_22,_2013_-_All's_Well_that_Maxwell "Don't Starve/Version History")* update, it was possible to obtain two Chesters when traveling between levels.
* A three-dimensional Chester can be downloaded and interacted with in Snapchat.[[2]](#cite_note-2)
* There is an unused Ballonicorn Chester stored in the game files. This version of Chester was supposed to be exclusive to the unused [Pyro](/wiki/Unimplemented_Characters "Unimplemented Characters") character.
* According to [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff"), Chester has nine stomachs - the exact number of item slots he has. This might mean that Chester consumes the items the player stores in him and regurgitates them for the player afterwards. This would also mean that Chester grows three extra stomachs when he turns into Shadow Chester.
* If multiple Eye Bones exist in a world, or the player has a [Fishbone](/wiki/Fishbone "Fishbone") (Shipwrecked icon) in the same world as Chester via [console commands](/wiki/Console/Commands "Console/Commands") or bugs, Chester will follow whichever one is in the player's inventory.
  + Chester does not follow the [Ro Bin Gizzard Stone](/wiki/Ro_Bin_Gizzard_Stone "Ro Bin Gizzard Stone") (Hamlet icon).
* In update 1.4.4 for Terraria was added a new rare Deerclop's drop, the upside down yellow chester, which can be put on the head and which is called Dizzy's Rare Gecko Chester. It refers to the Dizzy Dizaster streamer who streams with an upside down yellow chester on his head.
* Streamer DizzyDizaster (who often streams with one chester on his head) received a Rare Gecko Chester in 2019, which exists in only 3 copies (1 at the streamer, 2 at the Klei office)
  + This Chester was later added as a hat in Terraria

## Mosquito Bugs[]

* Chester sometimes may not transform to Snow or Shadow variants. Dropping the Eye Bone and then picking it up again may fix this issue.
* In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC, it is possible to bring Chester to the world by clicking on the dropped Eye Bone while teleporting via the [Seaworthy](/wiki/Seaworthy "Seaworthy"). However, doing this will spawn an entirely new Chester, which means that objects stored inside him will not transfer. The old Chester will remain in the original world, safe with all things inside him.
* Because of how the hunger mechanics work for captured critters (such as Moleworms, Rabbits, or Bees in the player's inventory) it is possible to place them inside Snow Chester in order to halve the depletion rate of their hunger meter. This means a Rabbit will starve after 4 days instead of 2 inside Snow Chester.
* Sometimes Chester and Glommer cannot be killed even with force attack, except using blow darts.
