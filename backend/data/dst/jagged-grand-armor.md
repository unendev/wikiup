The Steadfast Grand Armor is an unlockable item added in the 2018 The Forge event. To unlock the Jagged Great Armor, the community needed to defeat the Great Hog Crucible Warrior N times. After unlocking, it drops on the 8th wave from the Scorpio.

It is armor for the body cell. Like sharp-toothed wood armor, it increases physical damage, but, unlike it, adds 50 points of maximum health to the wearer.
