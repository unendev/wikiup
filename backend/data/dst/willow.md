Don't Starve Together From the Ashes Willow Animated Short

 

Willow's backstory was revealed in an animated short titled *[From the Ashes](/wiki/Animated_shorts_and_trailers#From_the_Ashes "Animated shorts and trailers")*. An official summary of the short was provided in DST's [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium"):

*Willow always regarded being brought to [The Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant") as a new beginning. It allowed her to leave everything behind, after all. From a young age, Willow seemed to possess a knack for attracting bad luck. Orphaned at a young age and forced to live in a children's home with cruel caregivers, she soon found her nights plagued by shadowy visions of terrible creatures... creatures that could only be held at bay by her faithful teddy bear Bernie. But when Bernie was taken away as punishment for what her caregivers saw as unfit behavior, Willow was left to fend for herself when the shadows came for her. That's when she learned that nothing holds back the darkness like a roaring flame. Nothing is more comforting than watching your troubles light up and crumble to ash... It wouldn't be the last time Willow burned it all down to start anew.*

## Trivia[]

### In-Game[]

* Willow was added to the original *Don't Starve* Chrome build on August 7, 2012.[[2]](#cite_note-2)
* Willow's voice is played by a flute.
* Willow has a [skull](/wiki/Unimplemented_Items#Player_Skulls "Unimplemented Items") in the game files.
* Willow's previous perk, before the *[Strange New Powers](/wiki/Version_History#July_2,_2013_-_Strange_New_Powers "Version History")* update, was to light fires at her feet when in darkness, like she does when low on Sanity now.
* When struck by [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") in DLCs, Willow, like most other Characters, is shown to have bones in her hair. In addition to this, she has bones in her skirt.
* Willow was the second *Don't Starve Together* character to have a character update, the first being [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona").
* In *Don't Starve Together*, she has a unique idle animation in which she gives Bernie a hug. This only occurs when she has Bernie equipped in the hand slot.
* She is seen holding Bernie in her icons.
* Due to the short "[Inevitable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0-FKZG6tE4)," Willow is one of the few characters to have received actual voice acting, along with Maxwell, Charlie, and Wilson.

### Lore[]

* Willow was originally stated to be around her late teens.[[3]](#cite_note-3) However, Klei later said that Willow is in her early 20's.[[4]](#cite_note-4)
* According to her examinations of the [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent") and the [Siesta Lean-To](/wiki/Siesta_Lean-To "Siesta Lean-To"), Willow was a Girl Scout, and she earned all of the patches.
  + According to her examination quote for the [Pinetree Pioneer Hat](/wiki/Pinetree_Pioneer_Hat "Pinetree Pioneer Hat"), she wasn't actually in the organization, instead having "crashed" Girl Scouts.
* According to her examination of [Bacon and Eggs](/wiki/Bacon_and_Eggs "Bacon and Eggs"), she might be colourblind, either this or she was talking about real life eggs which have a yellow yolk rather than the eggs displayed on Bacon and Eggs, which appear blue.
* Sometimes a message like this may appear during the loading screen in DST: "Nothing brings Willow more comfort than snuggling her faithful teddy bear Bernie, and committing a playful bit of arson."

### Cultural References[]

* Willow's nickname may be a reference to *[Firestarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestarter_(novel) "wikipedia:Firestarter (novel)")*, a novel by Stephen King. In addition to this, both Willow and Bernie could be a reference to an event in the story where main character Charlie, a young girl, first manifests her pyrokinesis by setting her teddy bear on fire after tripping over it.
* Willow's Victorian skin set may be a reference to "[The Little Match Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Match_Girl "wikipedia:The Little Match Girl")", a short story by Hans Christian Andersen.
* Willow's "The Woeful" skin set from [Hallowed Nights](/wiki/Hallowed_Nights "Hallowed Nights") 2018 seems to reference the legend of [Lizzie Borden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzie_Borden "wikipedia:Lizzie Borden") as well as Wednesday Addams from *[The Addams Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family "wikipedia:The Addams Family")*

We never really established where Wilson is living or from but the "Gentleman Scientist" theme does kind of come from a "Proper English Gent" kind of personality. The story is 1920-ish. Willow is roughly in her early 20's." June 17, 2014.
