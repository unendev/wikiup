*Exclusive to:* Hamlet

**“**Ah. The end is nigh.**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell")

The **Aporkalypse** is an event in *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC that happens when all three sigils on the [Aporkalypse Calendar](/wiki/Aporkalypse_Calendar "Aporkalypse Calendar") align. Without player control, this happens on the start of the 61st day in a *Hamlet* world, the players would have gone through each season twice before the Aporkalypse. During this event, the world will constantly be lit up and tinted red, the result of an annular eclipse, and the player is completely immune to [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") out of [Interiors](/wiki/Category:Interiors "Category:Interiors"). Many creatures and aspects of the game change, getting much more difficult. The Aporkalypse lasts forever until the player reverses the Aporkalypse Calendar for the first time, then it lasts for 20 days if the player doesn't reverse the Aporkalypse Calendar the next time the Aporkalypse is triggered.

Pigs in Swinesbury and the Palace City will warn of the upcoming Aporkalypse about 7 days before it begins, saying "Doomsday is near!", "Fear and porktent!", "Porktentous figures!", "Something wicked this way comes!", "The aporkalypse approach-eth" and, "Woe, destruction, and decay!". This will replace their regular trading requests; however, they will still accept goods in exchange for oincs.

## Nightmare Fuel Effects[]

  + All [Mants](/wiki/Mant "Mant") hatch into [Mant Warriors](/wiki/Mant "Mant"). The new Mant Warriors now glow, emitting a very dim light that spreads across a large distance. Any new Mants spawned by the [Antcomb Home](/wiki/Antcomb_Home "Antcomb Home") automatically turn into Mant Warriors.

* The boss monster [Ancient Herald](/wiki/Ancient_Herald "Ancient Herald") spawns shortly after the **Aporkalypse** begins out of any Interiors. If killed, it will respawn in a short time.

## Prototype Strategy[]

This event is treacherous, with a constant sanity drain, many many bats, allies turning into enemies, and dangerous threat of the base-destroying Ancient Herald. One of the only positive improvements is that the player will never have to rely on light outside. However, unless the player wants to farm [Pig Skin?](/wiki/Pig_Skin "Pig Skin") from the Vampire Bats, get what Ancient Herald drops, or a drastic difficulty increase, avoiding this event by using the [Aporkalypse Calendar](/wiki/Aporkalypse_Calendar "Aporkalypse Calendar") is recommended.

For people starting the game, the Aporkalypse is a major difficulty spike. Since it's so infrequent, and can be easily controlled using the Aporkalypse Calendar, it is recommended to use the Calendar to skip the event until you are fully prepared. That being said, there are several things to keep in mind about the Aporkalypse.

* It is important to realize that this event is entirely within the player's control. Making a small camp near the ruins that contain the Aporkalypse Calendar will allow the player to either reap the benefits or avoid the consequences of the Aporkalypse.
* Having health recovery items will ensure the player does not die to the myriad of threats during this event.
* The Ancient Herald is an incredibly dangerous Boss especially for those who are unprepared, it may be advised to run when he first appears, as his attacks can destroy a player's camp. It should be noted that he does not become aggressive should the player run, and then return to him. He will engage the player should they attack him again.
* It is a good idea to get your shopping done before the event, as [Pig Shops](/wiki/Pig_Shops "Pig Shops") will be locked at all times.
* [Wendy](/wiki/Wendy "Wendy") has a natural advantage compared to other characters, due to [Abigail](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail") dealing maximum damage at all times. Along with Wendy's reduced sanity drain, she is capable of surviving much longer than other characters are.
* [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") can bank SYSTEM OVERLOAD much more easily, since Thunderbirds shoot 10 lightning bolts. However this may kill other characters, causing them to be hurt and stunned if hit by a bolt.

## Red Firecrackers Fiesta[]

If the player survives an Aporkalypse minimum 2 days in a row before resetting the Aporkalypse Calendar, the Pig Traders in Swinesbury and the Palace City will throw a [Fiesta](/wiki/Pig_Fiesta "Pig Fiesta"). The celebration will last multiple days and the Pig Traders will not retreat to their homes in the afternoon or night until the Fiesta ends. In addition, multiple structures and food sold from the Sterling Trough Deli will be redecorated, having a more festive appearance.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Aporkalypse was added in the *[Aporkalypse](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet#Version_History "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* update.
* Aporkalypse is a portmanteau of pork and apocalypse.
* The fact that the Aporkalypse happens when the Aporkalypse Calendar aligns the three sigils is likely based on the 2012 phenomenon, which was an apocalypse believed to happen once the real world Mayan Calendar ended during the 21st of December 2012 (a year before Don't Starve's release).
* The Aporkalypse does not have its own combat music for non-bosses and instead plays the [Autumn](/wiki/Seasons/Autumn "Seasons/Autumn") music. This could be the result of a bug.

## Mosquito Bugs[]

* Sometimes seasonal effects, such as [Hay Fever](/wiki/Hay_Fever "Hay Fever") or [Fog](/wiki/Fog "Fog"), won't occur during the first Aporkalypse. However they will still occur during the second and above Aporkalypse.[Verification Needed]
* Sometimes the Fiesta can still be going on during the Aporkalypse. Pig traders will remain outdoors celebrating despite it being night, although Pig Guards will not be outside, and will remain in their towers. Pig shops will not be open but will keep their festive redesign.
* When the player constructs their own pig shop during the Aporkalypse, the player will be allowed to enter despite it being night. The shop keeper will use their normal quotes and be sitting at their desk to sell items, as if it was day. When the it goes to the next 'day' the shop becomes locked as per usual during night time.[Verification Needed]
