**“**It's a wonder anything grows in this climate at all.**”**

–[Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie")

The **Desert** [Biome](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes") is found in the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC. Commonly found in this biome are [Hound Mounds](/wiki/Hound_Mound "Hound Mound"), [Tumbleweeds](/wiki/Tumbleweed "Tumbleweed"), [Cacti](/wiki/Cacti "Cacti"), [Buzzards](/wiki/Buzzard "Buzzard"), and [Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder"). Occasionally there are [Spiky Trees](/wiki/Spiky_Tree "Spiky Tree"), [Spiky Bushes](/wiki/Spiky_Bush "Spiky Bush"), and [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft"). In each Desert Biome there is typically a herd of 3-4 [Volt Goats](/wiki/Volt_Goat "Volt Goat"). The Desert is mostly covered with [Sandy Turf](/wiki/Sandy_Turf "Sandy Turf"), though it does have large patches of bare ground as well.

Deserts are commonly found as a standalone biome at the edge of the world, rarely manifesting itself in the mainland between other biomes. In *Reign of Giants*, the desert is the only location where Hound Mounds and Tumbleweeds spawn.

Hound Mounds are most often found in a single cluster in this Biome, surrounded and interspersed with regular and Gold Vein Boulders. Given its large area, it is a common place to find at least one of the [Things](/wiki/Things "Things") or a major world feature like [Maxwell's Door](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door").

The desert has a chance to contain the Summer version of the Ice Box trap [Set Piece](/wiki/Set_Piece#Icebox_Trap "Set Piece"). This Ice Box trap will start [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") at one of its hottest temperatures instead of [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter").

Deserts can be an abundant source of many important items, such as: Hounds, from Hound Mounds, which can be a good source of [Hound's Teeth](/wiki/Hound%27s_Teeth "Hound's Teeth"); Tumbleweeds, which are a reliable source of [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs") and [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), even during Winter, and can contain many other previously non-renewable materials such as gems; Boulders, for a source of [Rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks"), [Nitre](/wiki/Nitre "Nitre"), and [Gold](/wiki/Gold "Gold"); [Bones](/wiki/Bones "Bones"), which can be broken for [Bone Shards](/wiki/Bone_Shards "Bone Shards") and Hound's Teeth; Cacti, which are a source of [Cactus Flesh](/wiki/Cactus_Flesh "Cactus Flesh") and, during Summer, [Cactus Flowers](/wiki/Cactus_Flower "Cactus Flower"); and Volt Goats, a source of [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat"), [Volt Goat Horns](/wiki/Volt_Goat_Horn "Volt Goat Horn"), and [Electric Milk](/wiki/Electric_Milk "Electric Milk").

## Don't Starve Together icon Don't Starve Together[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, there is a Set Piece only found in this biome which contains multiple [Magma](/wiki/Magma "Magma") pools, burnt Spiky Trees and Bushes, and is the only place where the [Dragonfly](/wiki/Dragonfly "Dragonfly") spawns, regardless of the season. [Grass Gekkos](/wiki/Grass_Gekko "Grass Gekko") can often be found in groups wandering in this biome.

The [Antlion](/wiki/Antlion "Antlion") also spawns in a different Desert, during Summer. There, one can also find the [Lake](/wiki/Lake "Lake") in an [Oasis](/wiki/Set_Piece#Oasis "Set Piece") Set Piece featuring 12 [Birchnut Trees](/wiki/Tree/Birchnut "Tree/Birchnut") and 18 [Succulents](/wiki/Flower#Succulent "Flower"), which will be filled up with water during the same Season. Additionally, this Desert contains a visually different Cactus that works the same as the original one. In the same desert, [Sandstorms](/wiki/Sandstorm "Sandstorm") occur in Summer except in the area of the Oasis. Nothing in the Oasis Set Piece or in Sandstorms will smolder, making it ideal for mega bases.

Usually, Volt Goats are only present in the Antlion desert, while Hound Mounds and Tumbleweeds only appear in the Dragonfly desert.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The desert where the Oasis Set Piece is located can provide protection for flammable items and structures from smoldering during summer, though they can still be set ablaze through other means (such as tumbleweeds).
