The **World Generation screen** is the Transition/Loading phase between choosing a character and playing. It shows a pair of skinny shadow hands residing over a small globe that has small 2D models of most of the In-game [items](/wiki/Items "Items") or objects. It also shows phrases such as "Wrangling monsters" and "Insinuating Wilson's Beard". These phrases are split into two halves in the code and are randomly paired together in different variations.

The new Caves loading screen

 

When the player enters a Cave, there is a different, unique World Generation screen. The sphere is rocky instead of grassy or dirt-like, and one can see the many structures and animals of the Caves, such as [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnymen "Bunnymen"), [Stalagmites](/wiki/Stalagmite "Stalagmite") and [Mushtrees](/wiki/Mushtree "Mushtree").

## Don't Starve Together icon Loading Screen Tips[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, the loading screen will display tips and lore tidbits. They can be toggled in the Options menu.

### Survival Tips[]

* "I stumbled upon a rather [suspicious mound of dirt](/wiki/Suspicious_Dirt_Pile "Suspicious Dirt Pile")... perhaps it was left by a creature of some sort? This may require further investigation..." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "I find myself returning more and more frequently to my magnificent [science machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine"), busying myself with prototyping new tools to aid in our survival. After all, I must do something to keep myself sane in this strange place..." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "I fear I may no longer be able to trust my own eyes. I've been catching glimpses of [strange shadowy forms](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") at the edges of my vision with increasing frequency... surely they can't really be there?" -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "They say the [Shadow Queen](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") herself comes at night to snatch up anyone foolish enough to wander in the dark..." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "I finally worked up the courage to explore the [underground caverns](/wiki/Caves "Caves"). To my surprise, I found there was ample light provided by a most curious [glowing plant](/wiki/Light_Flower "Light Flower") that seems to grow naturally throughout the cave system. I've harvested some [bulbs](/wiki/Light_Bulb "Light Bulb") for further study." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* The [Pig men](/wiki/Pig "Pig") seem to harbor a deep dislike for the Constant's more monstrous denizens, attacking them on sight. While I personally can't blame them, it does pose a bit of a problem for [some](/wiki/Webber "Webber") [of my](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox") [compatriots](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt")..." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "Could've sworn I saw one of the trees [movin'](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard") when I was out choppin' firewood... must've been a trick of the light." -[W](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie")
* "It turns out that [Koalefants](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant") are a bit hardier than I expected. I (quite sensibly) decided to take a... strategic retreat until I'm better prepared." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "You know what they say, you can't get [charcoal](/wiki/Charcoal "Charcoal") without burning down a few trees!" -[W](/wiki/Willow "Willow")
* "Blast this [heat](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating")! Where's a nice, chilled drink when you need it?" -[M](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell")
* "The [rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") is proving to be a greater hindrance than I first anticipated. As if being [soaked to the bone](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") isn't dreadful enough, my tools keep slipping from my hands when I try to make use of them!" -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "I experimented with making a [rudimentary compass](/wiki/Compass "Compass") and discovered that this place does in fact seem to have a magnetic North. Curiously, it also pointed out the positions of my fellow camp mates who, as it turned out, had already crafted similar compasses of their own." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "A [flare](/wiki/Flare "Flare") was sent up from the forest last night. I know I should have set out immediately to help, but... well... I suppose I hesitated too long by the comforting glow of my campfire, and before I knew it the flare had faded from view. I do hope whoever it was is alright..." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "I've finally perfected my design for an ingenious (if I do say so myself) [device that stores important garden-based knowledge](/wiki/Gardeneer_Hat "Gardeneer Hat"). Certain naysayers might point out that it looks like nothing more than an overturned flowerpot worn on the head... some people simply don't have an eye for science." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "Once I've perfected a recipe, I find it helpful to write it down. Luckily, I've been able to cobble together a [rough cookbook](/wiki/Cookbook "Cookbook") for just such a thing out of some spare pieces of parchment. Now my mind is free to worry about more immediate things..." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "Recipes are useful, but a [true chef](/wiki/Warly "Warly") knows the importance of experimenting with new ingredients and flavors, and this world certainly provides an abundance of unusual things to choose from." -[W](/wiki/Warly "Warly")
* "The bushes I replanted by the camp are looking [sickly](/wiki/Disease "Disease")... I suspect they'll require some [extra care](/wiki/Manure "Manure") before they can produce any berries again." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "We shouldn't hurt things that don't hurt us. If we're mean, bad old Mr. [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") will come..." -[W](/wiki/Webber "Webber")
* "Last time I baited [my hook](/wiki/Sea_Fishing_Rod "Sea Fishing Rod") with berries I caught more [fish](/wiki/Ocean_Fishes "Ocean Fishes") than I could carry, but when I tried today? Barely a nibble! Guess the berry trick only works on some of 'em." -[W](/wiki/Characters "Characters")
* "What strange new islands and creatures might I encounter if I journey out to sea? I shudder to think... but curiosity has a tendency to get the better of me..." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "We nearly lost one of our number today. In a mad daze I created... something... that managed to pull our friend back to the land of the living, but... [whatever](/wiki/Telltale_Heart "Telltale Heart") [it](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet") [was](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy"), I fear I cannot rightfully say it was within the realm of science..." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "Today I was surprised to come upon a [cobbled road](/wiki/Road "Road") - how did this hallmark of civilization come to be in this untamed wilderness?" -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "The [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm") are fiercely territorial, and quick to defend [their](/wiki/Mermhouse "Mermhouse") [ho](/wiki/Merm_Flort-ifications "Merm Flort-ifications")[mes](/wiki/Craftsmerm_House "Craftsmerm House"). Though I honestly can't imagine anyone else wanting to take up residence in those [ram-shackle hovels](/wiki/Mermhouse "Mermhouse")..." -[M](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell")
* "From time to time I've spotted [bottles](/wiki/Message_in_a_Bottle#Don't_Starve_Together "Message in a Bottle") bobbing along the ocean currents, just out of reach from the shore. I have half a mind to construct a boat and retrieve one of them... I have a gut feeling that [someone](/wiki/Crabby_Hermit "Crabby Hermit") is trying to send out a message." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "I couldn't have imagined it, I'm certain I just saw [a piece of the moon](/wiki/Lunar_Island "Lunar Island") break off and crash into the ocean! Perhaps my compatriots will join me in a search for it..." -[W](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")
* "The moon in this world seems to hold some strange power over the creatures here. [It](/wiki/Shattered_Spider "Shattered Spider") [changes](/wiki/Moonrock_Pengull "Moonrock Pengull") [them](/wiki/Horror_Hound "Horror Hound")..." -[W](/wiki/Characters "Characters")

### Lore[]

* Time moves differently in the Constant. Instead of a monotonous forward march, seconds and eternities seem to throw caution to the wind and do-si-do backwards and forwards as they please.
* Wilson chose the path of an independent Gentleman Scientist after finding the university environment to be too stifling for a man of his ambitions. (The enormous bill the university sent him to pay for repairs to the chemistry lab had absolutely nothing to do with this.)
* Growing up, Winona always looked out for her younger sister. Even now, she can't help but feel that one day she'll be able to reach out into the darkness and pull Charlie back.
* Once the King of the Nightmare Throne, Maxwell now finds himself surviving alongside the very people he once tormented. Needless to say, it makes for a bit of an... awkward atmosphere.
* Maxwell (nÃ© William Carter) was once nothing more than a humble stage magician, until the discovery of a [mysterious tome](/wiki/Codex_Umbra "Codex Umbra") changed the course of his life forever.
* In the Constant, the darkness has a name. Have you met Charlie yet?
* "Nothing here is what it seems. If you're reading this, keep an eye on the rabbits, don't trust the statues, and don't mistake that thing hanging in the night sky for the moon..." -W
* Even with all the steps Woodie has taken to control his were-curse, there's little that can be done on nights when the moon is at its fullest.
* Nothing brings Willow more comfort than snuggling her faithful teddy bear [Bernie](/wiki/Bernie "Bernie"), and committing a playful bit of arson.
* Wickerbottom is of the firm belief that the pen is mightier than the sword. Words hold great power when used correctly.
* Nothing could ever come between Wendy and her twin sister [Abigail](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail"). Some bonds transcend even death.
* Once upon a time, a little boy was swallowed up whole by a big hungry spider. Now they share everything; a body, a mind, and the name Webber.
* Walter's time in the Pinetree Pioneers has made him more prepared than most for surviving in the wilderness. Unfortunately, this is undermined somewhat by his blind fascination with monsters.
* "You can't run from [Them](/wiki/Them "Them") forever. Take it from me, pal." -M
* "It seems that every time we discover a [doorway](/wiki/Ancient_Gateway "Ancient Gateway") out of this terrible place, it just leads to [more strange worlds with](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge") [new horrors to endure](/wiki/The_Gorge "The Gorge"). Still, I can't give up hope that one day we'll find a doorway that will take us home..." -W

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* It is possible for "Game Theory" to show up in the second half of the phrases. Game Theory is the mathematical study of cooperation and conflict between intelligent decision makers (i.e. the player and the metagame).
* It is possible for "Nyctophobia" or Thalassophobia" to appear in the second half of the phrases. Nyctophobia is the fear of darkness or the night, while Thalassophobia is the fear of the sea.
* The phrase "lovely roses", which can appear in the second half of the phrase in DST, seems to be a reference to [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie").
* The loading screen tips in *Don't Starve Together* were added in the [March 2022 QoL update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History#March_24,_2022_-_March_2022_QoL_Update "Don't Starve Together/Version History").
* Don't Starve Together Sometimes, the loading screen tip will be the description of the corresponding [Vignette](/wiki/Vignettes "Vignettes").
* The Overworld loading phrase combination "Reticulating pines..." may be a reference to a popularly used loading phrase "Reticulating splines" originally appearing in Maxis Studios' *SimCity 2000.*
