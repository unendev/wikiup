## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Chester can open and close his mouth.
* The arms of the Character figures are articulated and can hold one item per arm.
* The UPC code has Wilson's self-portrait.
* Inside the box, the first flap will say: "Generating Figure..." and the second flap will say: "You'd better find more figures to collect before night comes!", referring to the game's loading screen and Maxwell's warning at the start of the game, respectively. The third flap says "@Klei #DontStarve".
* Klei has stated that Maxwell is "super rare". [Verification Needed].
  + Despite this, he appears once each in three of the four layouts, whereas Wes only appears once each in two of the layouts.
* Based on the results, buying a retail box will give you a 3/4 chance of finding Maxwell.
