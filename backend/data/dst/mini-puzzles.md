[At 54 seconds of the trailer](https://youtu.be/aAM02IwLCds?t=54), you can see the inscription "I have more to tell you", which made it clear that there is not a big puzzle in the trailer. [Comatose](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/3173-dec-11-update-naughty-nice-preview-video/?do=findComment&comment=26265) was the first who find it

Throughout the trailer, small strips will appear, by collecting which you could get a teaser of the spider queen. The first one who collected all the stripes into a picture and processed it was [Excess](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/3173-dec-11-update-naughty-nice-preview-video/?do=findComment&comment=26539).

## [Long Live the Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhvzyHjStiE)[]

In the trailer for the Long Live the Queen update, at 00:07 you can see a [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel")

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/3f/Shovel teaser.png/revision/latest?cb=20220918183009 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/3f/Shovel teaser.png/revision/latest?cb=20220918183009 



 

In the trailer for the Long Live the Queen update, at 00:31 and 00:45 seconds, you can see an eye with horns referring to [Deerlops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops")

Around the same time as these events, the Klei developers sent out delicious pop-up holiday cards to three people: Reddit user Excess, YouTuber [Generikb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ET0S-AogVA&t=130s) and [falpatrick](https://www.youtube.com/user/falpatrick).

<https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/File:Excess_morse_puzzle.wav>

Each of the cards contained music from the game, and then interrupted by Morse code. [Excess on Reddit studied and found out](https://old.reddit.com/r/dontstarve/comments/1611vm/new_secret_message_need_help/) that each card has a different Morse code, which means it is also decrypted in different ways. Excess had: LAURASI. falpatrick had: BITLY. Generikb had ATHERIA. All it refers to a bit.ly link: [www.bit.ly/laurasiatheria](https://web.archive.org/web/20201019154056/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/sos/laurasiatheria/it-was-here.html). This redirected to a secret page on the official site. The image depicts a camp in a state of ruin, with hoof-prints going through it. The accompanying sound file is entitled “It was here”. The file contains some rather unsettling sounds - after the usual backdrop of DS sounds like Wilson talking, chopping down trees, and eating food, there comes an ominous rumbling and hissing. Heavy footsteps seem to approach, and smashing sounds follow. The clue “Laurasiatheria” indicated it was to be a large mammal.

In the trailer for the Turf! sometimes a shot of 25 shots with dots or dashes [cejoga](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/6301-dont-starve-update-trailer-turf/?do=findComment&comment=51990) collected all the dots, and after [Mr Higgsbury II](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/6301-dont-starve-update-trailer-turf/?do=findComment&comment=53230) collected the full picture.

The Spoiled Rotten trailer also featured dots and stripes. cejoga also found them all and put them together. It turned out the name file - "xbnyn.lua". The file found in the game files had a lot of text inside, which in the lua editor turned into an animated ASCII-animation. It was a teaser for [Koalefant](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant")

## [Music Box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cqltBz71ZM)[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/7c/Music Box screen.png/revision/latest?cb=20220824112146 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/7c/Music Box screen.png/revision/latest?cb=20220824112146 



 

Players found a link on the official website ([http://www.dontstarvegame.com/music-box](https://web.archive.org/web/20130128050513/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/music-box)) that led to a page with a video (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cqltBz71ZM>) of a person playing music. There are dots on the piece of paper that he passes through the music box, and the user cejoga tried to form a word using these dots. The first thing he posted was this picture.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/fc/Music Box attempt 1.png/revision/latest?cb=20220824111400 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/fc/Music Box attempt 1.png/revision/latest?cb=20220824111400 



 

It turned out that he did everything wrong, and a little later the text appeared on the page “*You’ve been so kind to play along, how unfortunate your notes are wrong.*” -M. The "*wrong*" incorrect had a hyperlink in it (<http://forums.kleientertainment.com/showthread.php?7550-The-Next-Update&p=62405&viewfull=1#post62405>). The link led to a discussion of this secret. Then, user Fat Goomba somehow corrected the picture and got this.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/3b/Music Box attempt 2.png/revision/latest?cb=20220824111903 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/3b/Music Box attempt 2.png/revision/latest?cb=20220824111903 



 

From this, the players received the message "BABEEEBEEFBABEEEBEEF" which referred to the addition of baby beefalo in the game.

## [Progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yibLVmn7R9o&t=77s)[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a7/Picture with Maxwell.png/revision/latest?cb=20220824113922 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a7/Picture with Maxwell.png/revision/latest?cb=20220824113922 



 

In the trailer for the Progress update, the person [gregj08](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/7537-dont-starve-update-trailer-progress/#entry63252) first discovered the QR code in the trailer at 2:16 seconds, this QR code introduced to the site with a picture with Maxwell (<https://web.archive.org/web/20160124221822/http://dontstarvegame.com:80/science/deeper-meaning/shhhh.html>) whose mouth is closed with a zipper. Sometimes the phrase “*Your eyes deceived you / I’m afraid they’ve lied” may appear briefly in the picture. / What matters most / is on the inside*”. This was a clue to what to look for in the html code of the page where the phrase “*Forbidden Knowledge doesn't come easy. To unzip these lips you'll need to take a long hard look inside.*” The word *"unzip*" refers to the zip file format. After the players did some minor manipulations with the picture, turning it into a zip file, they got a picture with Wilson in which he was attacked by shadows.

## [Insanity!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G45HaGCg-EY)[]

In the trailer for the "Insanity" update, shots of letters occasionally flash by. In total there are three such frames in the middle of each of which there is a yellow letter (M,A,X). On the poster for the update, you can see the inscriptions A15, M37, X83, A58. The letters from the trailer are used to form the phrase "SOON", which may have been a reference to the "A Winter's Tale" update or the "[Forbidden Knowledge Trailer Puzzle](/wiki/Forbidden_Knowledge_Trailer_Puzzle "Forbidden Knowledge Trailer Puzzle")"

## [A Little Rain Must Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wDYrPCYLiM)[]

In the A Little Rain Must Fall trailer, 25 frames with small square cutouts appear at some points. All cutouts were found by cejoga, put together by Boba2007. The result was an image of Clockwork Bishop and Clockwork Rook, which were not yet in the game at that time. At that time, they were simply called robots, due to the fact that they did not have an official name.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/e/e1/Robots.png/revision/latest?cb=20220830175543 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/e/e1/Robots.png/revision/latest?cb=20220830175543 



 

## [Doorway to Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rZGzqq9jDA)[]

In the trailer for the Doorway to Adventure update, cejoga found all the pieces, and Avelarius put it together into a single picture. The image is of Maxwell seated on a throne with shadow arms on both sides. This image will later be used as the character's portrait in the character select menu, so it was most likely a spoiler for Maxwell being playable.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/5a/Doorway to Adventure Maxwell.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220830175859 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/5a/Doorway to Adventure Maxwell.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220830175859 



 

## [The End is Nigh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoQTQlJM_r4)[]

In the trailer for The End is Nigh update, Boba2007 also found all the fragments and put everything together into a single picture. In the picture, Wilson takes an apple from Maxwell with a suspicious smile. An apple can act as a forbidden fruit and mean the forbidden knowledge that Wilson wants to get, and Maxwell wants to lure Wilson with the help of a forbidden fruit to the Constant.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/0/0f/Forbidden fruit %28Apple%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220830180910 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/0/0f/Forbidden fruit %28Apple%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220830180910 



 

## [The End of the Beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fae9tlgS3w4)[]

At the end of the trailer for The End of the Beginning update, when Maxwell appears at the end, a strange sound is heard that players were able to decode into the link [www.bit.ly/down-we-go](https://web.archive.org/web/20160528211905/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/speleology/through-the-rabbit-hole.html). The site had an image that was a spoiler for the upcoming update line with caves. The title of the picture is "hello-down-there.png"

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/c1/Hello-down-there.png/revision/latest?cb=20220830181415 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/c1/Hello-down-there.png/revision/latest?cb=20220830181415 



 

## Don't Starve Reign of Giants poster[]

If you light up the Reign of Giants DLC poster, you can see a small hidden inscription in the shadows. The inscription is the word "proelium". You need to add this to the end of the link to the multiplayer version of Don't Starve and get [http://www.dontstarvetogether.com/proelium](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419014129/http://www.dontstarvetogether.com:80/proelium).

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/52/Edited DLC poster.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220909185320 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/52/Edited DLC poster.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220909185320 



 

This link led to a site where Maxwell and Wilson slapped each other.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/55/Slap Fight.gif/revision/latest?cb=20150416223503 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/55/Slap Fight.gif/revision/latest?cb=20150416223503 



 

In the code of the site, you can notice a sequence of interjections imitating the sounds of blows or a slap. Some letters are not written in italics and if you combine them, you get the word "new reign".
