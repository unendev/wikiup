**Humid Season** is the second one of three [Seasons](/wiki/Season "Season") in the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC, starting on day 12 and ending on day 22, lasting 10 days. It is indicated with the world having a bright blue tint. Humid Season leads to [Lush Season](/wiki/Lush_Season "Lush Season"), so player should prepare for coming [Hay Fever](/wiki/Hay_Fever "Hay Fever"). A few weather changes occur during this season, like intense [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") and [Heavy Fog](/wiki/Heavy_Fog "Heavy Fog"). during the [Heavy Fog](/wiki/Heavy_Fog "Heavy Fog") the player may run slower if wearing a clothing item, and become wetter over time. It is probable that the [BFB](/wiki/BFB "BFB") will spawn during this time.

## Seasonal Changes[]

* It is comparable to [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring") in *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* and [Monsoon Season](/wiki/Monsoon_Season "Monsoon Season") in *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")*, as it rains a lot and [lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") is common and also [Winter](/wiki/Seasons/Winter "Seasons/Winter") since mobs such as [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterfly "Butterfly") and [Glowflies](/wiki/Glowfly "Glowfly") wont spawn during the season.
* [Heavy Fog](/wiki/Heavy_Fog "Heavy Fog") will surround the player often in this season
* Glowflies turn into Glowfly Cocoons, and then become [Rabid Beetles](/wiki/Rabid_Beetle "Rabid Beetle").
* [Great Leafy Stalks](/wiki/Great_Leafy_Stalk "Great Leafy Stalk") have a chance to spawn Glowfly Cocoons around them.

While the fog is around, the player's character will announce that their current armor or hat is too hot (Although, the player won't increase temperature or overheat) or too heavy and will move at a reduced speed. Taking off the clothing will make the player move back at normal speed.

The [Pith Hat](/wiki/Pith_Hat "Pith Hat") and [Cowl](/wiki/Cowl "Cowl") will negate the slowness that fog causes, allowing the use of the torso slot without being slowed. The [Weevole Mantle](/wiki/Weevole_Mantle "Weevole Mantle") will also cancel out the slowness that fog causes.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* In the *Hamlet* closed beta, Humid season didn't have its own work music, and instead played the [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") theme from the base game, but it did have its own unique combat theme. As of now, it has its own work theme.
