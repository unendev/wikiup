**“**That can't be good.**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

The **Dry Season** (also known as Volcano Season) is one of the four [Seasons](/wiki/Season "Season") in the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC. It is indicated by the world having yellow/orange tint, similar to [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") in *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC. By default, the first Dry Season begins on [day](/wiki/Day "Day") 56 and ends on day 71. During the Dry Season, nights are very short, and dusk starts long but becomes shorter in length as the season progresses.

Within the first days of the season, areas that were [Flooded](/wiki/Flooding "Flooding") during [Monsoon Season](/wiki/Monsoon_Season "Monsoon Season") begin to dry up. The temperatures soon rise to the point where [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") becomes a major issue, especially during the middle of the season. Overheating is not as severe compared to *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC's [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") season, and fires do not spontaneously start. In addition, overheating is usually not an issue during the first and last two days of Dry Season. Most plants like [Bamboo](/wiki/Bamboo "Bamboo"), [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft"), [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush"), and even [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") can wither, making them non-functional unless treated. This effect also extends to [Basic Farms](/wiki/Farm "Farm") and [Improved farms](/wiki/Farm "Farm"), [Limpet Rocks](/wiki/Limpet_Rock "Limpet Rock") can wither as well.

During Dry Season, the ocean is calmer with fewer waves. The waves get less frequent towards the end of the season. Fishing with a [Trawl Net](/wiki/Trawl_Net "Trawl Net") during Dry Season will yield the greatest variety of catch, including a chance to obtain [Obsidian](/wiki/Obsidian "Obsidian").

Dry Season is followed by [Mild Season](/wiki/Mild_Season "Mild Season").

## Volcanic Eruptions[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Volcano (object)#Eruptions](/wiki/Volcano_(object)#Eruptions "Volcano (object)")*

Soon after the flooded areas have dried up completely, the [Volcano](/wiki/Volcano "Volcano") will start to erupt. Tremors occur three times before each eruption, giving slightly more than half of a day to prepare. When the volcano erupts, [Dragoon Eggs](/wiki/Dragoon_Egg "Dragoon Egg") rain down from the sky, each briefly showing a shadow where it will land, and targeting areas within and slightly beyond the player's view.

## Prototype Strategy[]

Since falling Dragoon Eggs tend to cause havoc, it is recommended to leave any established bases and retreat to a location with no or few combustible resources. The best places for this are barren landscapes and Shallow Ocean. Medium or Deep Ocean is recommended more during the middle of the season where overheating is a major problem and wetness can provide emergency cooldown. The ocean is a less viable option during the last days of the season when the frequency of eruptions rises dramatically. Fortunately by that point, overheating is less of a problem.

a way to dodge meteors that rain down from the sky during Dry Season

 

The ashes that cover the screen during an eruption may hinder vision and make the shadows cast by the falling Dragoon Eggs harder to see. This makes places with darker turf, like [Magma Fields](/wiki/Magma_Field "Magma Field"), potentially dangerous places to ride out an eruption. Therefore, a sacrificial beach for volcanic eruptions may be needed. It is also a good idea to wear [Armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor") while dodging Dragoon Eggs on land. Wearing a [Log Suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit") with maximum [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") will allow any character to survive a direct hit. Combining a stronger armor with a helmet (such as a [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet")) will allow surviving multiple hits. For eruptions happening at night, a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") or [Endothermic Fire](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire "Endothermic Fire") can be built for protection from [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") and to be able to see the shadows of falling Dragoon Eggs. However, these can be destroyed if any eggs strike near them. While [Torches](/wiki/Torch "Torch") can be used, they do not provide a large light radius. Therefore, the best option is to use a [Bottle Lantern](/wiki/Bottle_Lantern "Bottle Lantern") or a [Miner Hat](/wiki/Miner_Hat "Miner Hat"). Landing Dragoon Eggs will sometimes form [Lava Pools](/wiki/Lava_Pool "Lava Pool"), which provide light with a fairly large radius, allowing the light source to be unequipped to save their durability. [Obsidian Fire Pits](/wiki/Obsidian_Fire_Pit "Obsidian Fire Pit") are another alternative for providing light during a night eruption as a fully fueled Obsidian Fire Pit provides light for a large area. However, this may be a bit risky, since if the player gets close to the fire pit, landing Dragoon Eggs can destroy the Obsidian Fire Pit, eliminating the light source.

If the Volcano has been found, another strategy is to prevent eruptions altogether by going inside and making offerings to the [Volcano Altar of Snackrifice](/wiki/Volcano_Altar_of_Snackrifice "Volcano Altar of Snackrifice"). Building a small base inside the Volcano and spending the duration of Dry season there can allow the player to survive, collect resources specific to the Volcano biome, and continuously make offerings of appeasement with relatively low effort. [Eggs](/wiki/Eggs "Eggs") provide a fairly high appeasement value and can be obtained by feeding cooked [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") to a [bird](/wiki/Birds "Birds") in a [Birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage"). Monster Meat can be obtained by killing [Dragoons](/wiki/Dragoon "Dragoon") inside the Volcano. An [Ice Maker 3000](/wiki/Ice_Maker_3000 "Ice Maker 3000") and a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") can subsequently nullify the player's hunger problems, as the [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") and [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice") can be used to make [Meatballs](/wiki/Meatballs "Meatballs"). The ice can also be eaten to cool the player if [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") occurs. The majority of the materials needed to craft these structures can be found inside the Volcano itself. [Turf](/wiki/Turf "Turf") inside the volcano, though non-renewable, can be used as an easy-to-obtain fuel source for fire pits (an [Endothermic Fire Pit](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire_Pit "Endothermic Fire Pit") is recommended) and for the [Ice Maker 3000](/wiki/Ice_Maker_3000 "Ice Maker 3000"). The time spent between making offerings can be used to gather resources that are only found in the Volcano, such as [Obsidian](/wiki/Obsidian "Obsidian"), [Coffee Plants](/wiki/Coffee_Plant "Coffee Plant") and [Elephant Cacti](/wiki/Elephant_Cactus "Elephant Cactus").

In the dry season land based food sources such as [Farms](/wiki/Farming "Farming") or [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush") become effectively unusable preparing alternate sources such as trawl nets or fishing poles will be very advantageous. Alternatively if you have a large amount of [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure"), crops can be quickly grown before they have time to wilt.

In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC, Volcanic Eruptions do not effect/occur in [interior areas](/wiki/Category:Interiors "Category:Interiors").
