The **Deerclops** is a [Boss](/wiki/Category:Boss_Monsters "Category:Boss Monsters") [Monster](/wiki/Monster "Monster") that is only active during [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), unless edited in [World Customization](/wiki/World_Customization "World Customization"). It has big [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") and does big damage and can destroy [Structures](/wiki/Structure "Structure") and [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree"), making it very dangerous if it enters the player's camp. The Deerclops is aggressive towards anything it encounters and can kill most [Creatures](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") easily. Its monstrous appearance drains [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") quickly when the character gets too close.

Deerclops takes four blasts from the [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff") to be frozen, and four [Sleep Darts](/wiki/Sleep_Dart "Sleep Dart") to put to sleep. When killed, it will drop 8 pieces of [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") and a [Deerclops Eyeball](/wiki/Deerclops_Eyeball "Deerclops Eyeball"), which does not spoil, and restores a high amount of Health and [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") but drains Sanity. Its big eyeball can also be used to craft the [Eyebrella](/wiki/Eyebrella "Eyebrella") and [Houndius Shootius](/wiki/Houndius_Shootius "Houndius Shootius").

–[Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda"), when a Deerclops is near.

The Deerclops spawns during Winter near the player. Its approach is signalled by a deep moaning sound, which the character will eventually comment on, similar to the way that [Hounds](/wiki/Hound "Hound") are signalled. Unlike Hounds, the Deerclops will not follow the player wherever they go, the player can move away and, with skill, leave the Deerclops behind to despawn when Winter ends.

The Deerclops has an attack in which it will either swipe or pound the floor at its current target. Both animations have the same effect (the animation seen depends on which direction the Deerclops is facing), damaging all mobs and structures within a radius of about 2.5 berry bushes. It usually does not immediately target the player upon arrival, having an "aggro distance" toward any mob it gets close to. The Deerclops first tries to target the closest structure to the player at time of being spawned; if no structure is close enough to the player, then the player is targeted instead (although this tends to be rare). The Deerclops will not target [walls](/wiki/Wall "Wall") unless the object or mob that the Deerclops is aiming to destroy is behind a wall. Often, walls and other structures or mobs nearby may suffer collateral damage despite what the Deerclops may target, so walls do not stand up well to a Deerclops.

The Deerclops aims to destroy all structures until it is happy about itself, after which it will then leave. Note that the only structures counted are the ones targeted by the Deerclops directly - collateral damage is not counted, meaning many more structures may be destroyed before the Deerclops is finished. Naturally, if the Deerclops is aggroed by the player or other mobs, it will hang around to take care of them first, before continuing to destroy structures or leave.

It is possible to stay out of the way as it passes by. However, the Deerclops can easily ravage the structures in the player's camp, with [Pig Houses](/wiki/Pig_House "Pig House") and [Rabbit Hutches](/wiki/Rabbit_Hutch "Rabbit Hutch") being especially costly. If the Deerclops is defeated close enough to structures, it will damage or destroy them due to it collapsing on top of them.

Once killed, the Deerclops takes 3–6 days to respawn. It will despawn around about the time when [summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") comes (the exact time depends on how fast the snow melts, as the Deerclops has thresholds, unless it has been configured to "Lots" in the world menu). If it is onscreen when it is supposed to be gone, it will simply despawn.

If the player happens to be in the [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") during Winter and they come out, it is possible for the Deerclops to be waiting for them at the entrance.

## Hunting[]

:   *For instructions on how to prepare for fighting Deerclops, see [Guides/Preparing for Deerclops](/wiki/Guides/Preparing_for_Deerclops "Guides/Preparing for Deerclops").*

The Deerclops can be kited, a process by which the player attacks, moves away to avoid an attack, then attacks again. It is possible to strike the Deerclops three times in between attacks, or four times if the player is walking over [Cobblestones](/wiki/Cobblestones "Cobblestones") or [Road](/wiki/Road "Road"), or can quickly equip a [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane"). It is highly recommended to stick to three or even two hits if one doesn't know the exact hitbox of the Deerclops. The player must time their attacks with the Deerclops's animations, as its long and wide ranged melee attack is hard to dodge even with a mighty Wolfgang's speed. Its big health means this will take time, however, and the character's Sanity will drop very quickly. [Armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor") should be worn when attempting this as the Deerclops can kill most characters in two strikes. Two or three [Log Suits](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit") and [Football Helmets](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet") should be enough to absorb some damage, and around 10 pieces of [Jerky](/wiki/Jerky "Jerky") should be enough to recover health and mitigate the sanity loss. A [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane") and timed clicking can increase the ability to dodge her attacks in between the player's blows, and gives a speed boost to run away if necessary. In *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* (RoG), a Deerclops's attacks will freeze the player after two hits, unless the player places a fire source next to them.

The Deerclops does not sleep during the night, but it can be put to sleep by a [Pan Flute](/wiki/Pan_Flute "Pan Flute") or [Sleep Darts](/wiki/Sleep_Dart "Sleep Dart"). [Fire Darts](/wiki/Fire_Dart "Fire Dart") or the [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff") are also effective. However, it will take a large amount of hits to kill it, and may result in the loot it drops turning to [Ashes](/wiki/Ashes "Ashes"). In this case, 8 [Cooked Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") will drop but no [Deerclops Eyeball](/wiki/Deerclops_Eyeball "Deerclops Eyeball") as it would have been burned. The Deerclops can also be frozen and then attacked from behind.

The Deerclops can be easily killed by using the [Snurtle Shell Armor](/wiki/Snurtle_Shell_Armor "Snurtle Shell Armor"). Before it strikes, one should hide in the shell, then emerge and strike between its attacks.

With Mighty [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang"), the player can simply tank the Deerclops with a [Tentacle Spike](/wiki/Tentacle_Spike "Tentacle Spike") or [Ham Bat](/wiki/Ham_Bat "Ham Bat") without any sort of armor and will be able to kill her and survive with some Health left.

If the player happens to have a lot of [Tooth Traps](/wiki/Tooth_Trap "Tooth Trap"), they can lead the Deerclops to an open area covered in the traps. As with other aggressive creatures, it will walk towards the player without avoiding the traps. It will take 34 sprung traps to kill the Deerclops, but the player can kite it to speed up the process.

Alternatively, the Deerclops can be lured to fight other creatures, but the player should be warned because the Deerclops has an "Area of Effect" (AoE) attack. For example, if the Deerclops were lured to a group of [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo"), it will hit several at the same time and thus cause them to attack. It is advised to have an Ice Staff in this situation, as the Deerclops can make quick work of a small to medium Beefalo herd. Using the staff on it as it prepares to strike will stun it and cancel its attack, protecting the Beefalo in the process. A fully occupied [Tallfort](/wiki/Set_Piece "Set Piece") of around 20 [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird") is capable of killing Deerclops in the same manner. [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard") will also fight the Deerclops and are very effective. [Walrus Camps](/wiki/Walrus_Camp "Walrus Camp") can also be used, as [MacTusk](/wiki/MacTusk "MacTusk") can dodge Deerclops's attacks and possibly kill it given enough time.

Another way to kill the Deerclops involves having a neutral Treeguard nearby one's base. The player should guide the Deerclops into trees to destroy them or let it attempt to hit the character while nearby a Treeguard, as its AoE attack will hit the Treeguard if close enough. The large Treeguard will kill the Deerclops with health to spare. If one attempts to use this strategy in RoG, one Treeguard will not be sufficient to kill the Deerclops, since its freeze effect will work on Treeguards and allow the Deerclops to land enough hits to kill a single opponent.

The quickest method of killing the Deerclops, aside from using the [Old Bell](/wiki/Old_Bell "Old Bell"), requires [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder") and a [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch") or [Willow's Lighter](/wiki/Willow%27s_Lighter "Willow's Lighter"). Gunpowder deals 200 damage, and thus, 10 units of them would instantly kill the Deerclops. Place the gunpowder, 9 in a stack, as close as possible to the Deerclops (it is recommended to freeze or put it to sleep to hold it still). Next, light the gunpowder with a torch and run. To deal with the Deerclops's remaining health, attack it with non-fire weapons. As stated, only 9 units of gunpowder should be used, since the player presumably wants its eyeball not to become ash if it dies while lit on fire.

Alternatively, the Deerclops can easily be lost by moving a good distance away, or by jumping into a [Worm Hole](/wiki/Worm_Hole "Worm Hole"). After losing interest in the character, she will find something else to smash or attack. A [Bush Hat](/wiki/Bush_Hat "Bush Hat") will keep the character hidden if necessary, but if it has already aggroed onto the player, this method will not work. Below is the number of hits it takes with each weapon to kill a Deerclops when playing with characters with a default damage modifier. The [Weather Pain](/wiki/Weather_Pain "Weather Pain") is not included due to the random nature of its projectile.

## Deerclops Options[]

Deerclops attack frequencies may be adjusted in World Customization as follows:

| Option | Number of Attacks per Season | Attacks During Summer? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | 0 | No |
| Default | 1 | No |
| Less | 1 | No |
| More | 2 | No |
| Lots | 3 | Yes |

As one can see from the table, "default" and "less" is actually the same setting. The "More" setting adds up to 2 attacks per season, while the "Lots" setting ups that to 3 attacks per season, which includes both winter and summer. Note that even on the final setting, the Deerclops will still despawn once summer starts (but not when winter starts) - meaning any Deerclops spawned during summer will not actually despawn until the next summer begins on that setting.

Additionally, the spawning of Deerclops appears to be tied to the change of snow cover, which regulates when a new Deerclops may spawn. This has the effect that even if Deerclops is set to default, and then killed near the end of winter (when the snow cover may change, but still be above the threshold required for a winter Deerclops), it is entirely possible for another Deerclops to spawn very soon afterwards.

Due to the way snow cover change regulates the Deerclops spawning, the actual number of attacks one will experience may vary wildly from that in the "setting". That is, at best, all one can know for sure is that setting it higher will probably result in more attacks on average, with the possibility of a summer attack on the final setting.

When set to the "Default" or "Less" Deerclops setting, it is possible to survive through multiple winters without seeing or hearing the Deerclops. In theory, setting Deerclops to "More" should guarantee that Deerclops attacks will occur at least once per winter.

## https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f8/Reign of Giants icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20140408110712 Reign of Giants[]

In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, Deerclops is now the giant of Winter, gaining the ability to freeze its victims. It will take two hits from the Deerclops to freeze either the player or a mob, the first hit will turn the target blue, and the next one will freeze it. This makes certain tactics involving the use of neutral mobs such as [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") or [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnymen "Bunnymen") ineffective.

## Don't Starve Together Don't Starve Together[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* (DST), by default, there is at most one Deerclops per winter.

The first Deerclops generally first spawn on Day 30.8. If no player is on the surface world or mainland, its spawn is delayed until someone is, after which it will spawn in 60 seconds. The Deerclops respawns from dying after 16.8 Winter days. Since the default winter length is 15 days, this is more than a season and will always be 71.8 days after the kill (or 126.8 if killed on the last 1.8 days of winter). If killed after winter, like in spring, it respawns after 2.8 winter days by default. The Deerclops spawns at Day 30.8, 102.6, and 174.4 plus however long it took to kill it, by default. The number of Deerclops spawned per winter can be increased with world configuration, or with [Hostile Flares](/wiki/Hostile_Flare "Hostile Flare").

Deerclops prioritises spawning on players with at least 5 structures within 20[m](/wiki/Distance "Distance"), spawning 40m away from its targeted player. Deerclops targets players within 16m, followed by structures within 40m. it despawns after destroying at least 5 structures, and all structures within 40m of the Deerclops. The Deerclops respawns with the same health it had when it despawned; 2.8 winter days after despawning. If the Deerclops was killed, it respawns, with full health, after 6 times the attack interval; which, on default settings, prevents attacks for the rest of the season. The default programmed number of attacks is 4, but this number is generally useless for player. The attack interval is (season length - 1)/(number of attacks + 1) days.

Deerclops' attack in a 30° cone with a 12m radius. Each attack of Deerclops adds 2 coldness and reduces the player temperature by 5, but not below the environment temperature. A player generally freezes after receiving 2 consecutive attacks from Deerclops.

On death, the Deerclops drops a [Sketch](/wiki/Sketch "Sketch"), which allows players to craft a Deerclops [Figure](/wiki/Chess_Pieces#Deerclops_Figure "Chess Pieces") at a [Potter's Wheel](/wiki/Potter%27s_Wheel "Potter's Wheel").

Should The Lunar Rift be active, Crystal Deerclops will spawn after the death the Deerclops, if its carcass is not burnt. [Crystal Deerclops](/wiki/Crystal_Deerclops "Crystal Deerclops") count as Deerclops in spawning mechanism. For instance, Deerclops generally respawns 71.8 days after the death of Crystal Deerclops.

### Winter's Feast Winter's Feast[]

During [Winter's Feast](/wiki/Winter%27s_Feast "Winter's Feast"), the Deerclops has a different appearance: it has dark fur and a glowing red eye. It can shoot a laser from its eye to attack players from medium range, without following a particular pattern. Additionally, Winter's Feast Deerclops emits a fair amount of red light that can ward off [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") if the player stands nearby.

### DST Strategy[]

* Players can kite Deerclops by running behind, running perpendicular from, running diagonally away from Deerclops, after hitting 5-7 times.
* Players can safely bombard Deerclops from the [Boat](/wiki/Boats "Boats"), using ranged weapons such as [Houndius Shootius](/wiki/Houndius_Shootius "Houndius Shootius") or [Winona's Catapult](/wiki/Winona%27s_Catapult "Winona's Catapult").

## Trivia[]

* The Deerclops was added in *[A Winter's Tale](/wiki/New_Features#February_26,_2013_-_A_Winter.27s_Tale "New Features")* update. At the end of the update's trailer, the screen goes black for a brief amount of time. During this time, the growl of the Deerclops is heard.
* The name "Deerclops" is a portmanteau of "Deer" and "Cyclops".
* Pictures of the Deerclops appeared in the teaser video for the *[Long Live the Queen](/wiki/Version_History#December_19.2C_2012_.E2.80.93_Long_Live_the_Queen.5B12.5D "Version History")* update, at around 30 and 45 seconds into the video (see pictures). It's clear that the image shown was an older/simplified design.
* Although it's usually not possible to see two Deerclops spawn at the same time, if this happens (due to a bug or by spawning it via the console) they will be hostile to each other, unlike other boss monsters.
* According to [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell"), Deerclops are [myopic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia "wikipedia:Myopia").
* Sometimes the moaning noises can be heard, but the Deerclops does not seem to spawn. This happens when the snow melts below a certain threshold (e.g. when summer begins) after the Deerclops is about to appear.
* Artwork of the Deerclops can be used as a rare [Steam](/wiki/Steam_Content "Steam Content") profile wallpaper.
* Despite being a monster, the Deerclops drops normal meat rather than monster meat.
* Its Winter's Feast appearance may be a reference to [Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer "wikipedia:Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"), although it has a glowing-red eye instead of a nose.
* Even though other characters refer to the Deerclops as male, [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt") calls it a female.
  + Wurt's observation is supported in the [Glass Eyebrella](/wiki/Belongings#Eyebrella "Belongings") skin description, which refers to the Deerclops as a female.
* [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber")'s quote may be a reference to his title, *The Indigestible*.
* If allowed to destroy 5-6 structures it intentionally targeted, Deerclops will do a relaxed expression/attempt to smile, and then proceed to go off screen to despawn unless aggroed again. This cycle will repeat.
* The Deerclops appeared in Re-Logic's *Terraria* Desktop 1.4.3 version as a crossover boss. See also: Deerclops' entry in the Official Terraria Wiki.

## Bugs[]

* Note that in the base game if the Deerclops is killed prior to the start of summer, another one may be spawned to replace it within a few days. Deerclops that are respawned in this way are counted as being part of the same attack, so the total number of Deerclops spawned during a season may actually be higher than the "number of attacks per season" listed in the Options. This is suspected to be a bug since the attack is supposed to cease immediately after the Deerclops is spawned.
* In *Reign of Giants*, the sound effect for the freezing attack is extremely loud and will stay loud even if the in-game volume sliders are all on 0.
