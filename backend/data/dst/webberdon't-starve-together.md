In [Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together"), Webber can safely eat [Monster Foods](/wiki/Monster_Food "Monster Food") without any adverse health effects, grow a silky smooth beard, and befriend [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider"). Webber can also safely eat raw [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") without penalties.

Webber starts the game with 2 [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat"), a [Webby Whistle](/wiki/Webby_Whistle "Webby Whistle"), and [Spider Eggs](/wiki/Spider_Eggs "Spider Eggs") that can be used to plant a [Spider Den](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den").

## Spider Spiders[]

Alongside Spiders being neutral to Webber unless provoked, he may also give them any sort of Meat item to ally up to 3 Spiders at a time. Follower Spiders do not have a loyalty timer unlike other follower mobs and will only stop following due to their or Webber's death, disconnections, travel between the caves and surface, or the Shoo Box.

Once befriended, Spiders will fight alongside Webber and may be picked up and carried within the inventory. Spiders in the inventory can be fed with meat to lengthen their life. Spiders may also be picked up when they're asleep, or trapped within a [Trap](/wiki/Trap "Trap"). Spiders remember whether or not they were befriended after dropping them from the inventory. Feeding a Spider in the inventory will befriend it if it wasn't already, and can befriend nearby Spiders as well.

Hats can be equipped to Spiders, both befriended and not, which will give them the appropriate effects of the hat where applicable. Picking up the Spider will put the hat in your inventory as well. If the Spider dies or retreats back into a den, the hat will drop onto the ground.

As long as Webber is the one carrying the [Eye Bone](/wiki/Eye_Bone "Eye Bone") or [Star-Sky](/wiki/Star-Sky "Star-Sky"), Spiders will not attack [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester") or [Hutch](/wiki/Hutch "Hutch") respectively. This does **not** apply to Spider Queens or to the Spiders spawned by them.

### Dens[]

Webber has the ability to shave any Spider Den using the [Razor](/wiki/Razor "Razor") to downgrade them by 1 level. Shaving a Spider Den will give one Silk for each stage. Shaving a den also destroys decorations on the den and can destroy a den if it is level 1. Destroying a den this way will cause all Spiders inside to become aggressive towards Webber. Webber can also upgrade a Spider Den to the next stage by using 5 Silk on it.

Webber can decorate dens with the Den Decorating Set. Decorated dens have a much smaller webbing size, stop growing, and pacify all Spiders that come within a certain radius of the den. Attacking a Spider from a decorated den will destroy the decorations and revert it back to a regular one. As the effects are applied due to proximity, a decorated den can apply its effects to a non-decorated one as long as it is close enough.

Webber has also the ability to [sleep](/wiki/Sleeping "Sleeping") inside Level 3 dens to gain HP and Sanity in exchange for Hunger. The Hunger drain is slightly higher while the HP and Sanity gains are slightly lower than when sleeping in a [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent"). Sleeping inside a den will stop it from growing for some time even after waking up and prevent Webber from getting hit by darkness while inside. Preventing the den from increasing in stage also means that it will not spawn a [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen") for some time after being slept in. Additionally, Webber gains a slight movement speed boost when walking on the webbing that surrounds Spider dens.

## Silky Farmspider Beard Icon Silky Beard[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a4/Webber Beard Growth.png/revision/latest?cb=20140506083517 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a4/Webber Beard Growth.png/revision/latest?cb=20140506083517 

Webber's different stages of beard growth.

 

Webber grows a beard made of Silk much like [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") grows one made of [hair](/wiki/Beard_Hair "Beard Hair"). It takes 3 days per stage of beard growth, a total of 9 days for full length (compared to 16 days for Wilson). Webber's silky beard provides 3/4 as much insulation from [freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") as Wilson's beard would. When Webber is revived by any means, his beard will disappear.

Webber's beard can also be shaven in stages by using a Razor. Shaving will restore 10 Sanity per stage and drop Silk. Shaving every 3 days is half as efficient as waiting for the full beard to grow out (0.33 Silk/day vs. 0.67 Silk/day). Below is the days it takes Webber to grow his beard to the next stage, along with the number of Silk gained and insulation provided with each stage.

| Days until growth | Length | Silk yield | Insulation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 days | Short beard | Silkx 1 | 11.25 |
| 6 days | Long beard | Silk× 2 | 33.75 |
| 9 days | Silky Smooth beard | Silk× 3 | 67.5 |

Webber has unique alternative skins for his [Beards](/wiki/Beards "Beards"), corresponding to each of their skin collections. If a player owns a beard skin, it will automatically grow over their regular beard when the player is using the matching head skin. Beards can be changed with the use of a [Clean Sweeper](/wiki/Clean_Sweeper "Clean Sweeper") by the player on themselves.

## Disadvantages[]

* Neutral mobs that are hostile to Spiders will also be hostile to Webber. This means that [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig"), [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnymen "Bunnymen"), and [Catcoons](/wiki/Catcoon "Catcoon") will attack Webber on sight and cannot be befriended. Curiously, he can still trade with the [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King").
* Webber has a lower Sanity maximum, meaning he will experience changes in Sanity far quicker than other characters and is more susceptible to [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature"). He will also have a hampered ability to make use of the [Enlightened Crown](/wiki/Enlightened_Crown "Enlightened Crown").

## Prototype Tips[]

### General[]

* Webber's low sanity can easily be managed by crafting a [Top Hat](/wiki/Top_Hat "Top Hat") out of the Silk he collects from farming Spiders or shaving his Beard.
* As the beard doesn't grow longer after 9 days and the player loses it on resurrection, it is most efficient to shave after every 9th night.
  + As the Beard will take exactly 9 days to grow to its full length (full length at the beginning of day 10), the player can shave once to get the Silk and still have a full beard in time for Winter on day 21 (default settings). The player can easily survive the cold with just a full Beard and a [Thermal Stone](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone").
  + It is advised to shave at the beginning of Summer due to the beard accelerating the rate at which Webber overheats.
* Webber keeps his beard when using a [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing") to move to a new world. This proves useful in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") when "The King of Winter" or "The Game is Afoot" are still to be encountered.
* Due to his perks, Webber makes an excellent character for [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") and [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") exploration as there are far more Spiders underground than there are Bunnymen.
* Since Webber does not spawn Spiders when walking on webbing, it is advised to use [Glommer](/wiki/Glommer "Glommer") to make the Spiders come out, as Glommer can trigger their spawn even while flying and will not be attacked.
* While Webber can safely eat raw Meat, it is still advised to cook any stockpiled Meat in order to greatly increase its spoilage time. Both normal Meat and Monster Meat will rot after 6 days, while cooked Meat will rot after 10 and Monster Meat after 15.
* Webber's [favorite food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Ice Cream](/wiki/Ice_Cream "Ice Cream"), meaning he gains an additional 15 Hunger when consuming the food.

### Spiders[]

* Befriended Spiders will eat any Meat, [Pig Skins](/wiki/Pig_Skin "Pig Skin") and [Bunny Puffs](/wiki/Bunny_Puff "Bunny Puff") dropped from their kill after a short time, so the player needs to act quickly if they want to collect these drops.
* Spiders will occasionally attack [Walls](/wiki/Wall "Wall"), so it is recommended to place any Walls away from the Spider Dens. Befriended and pacified Spiders will not attack walls.
* Spiders will attack [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester") on sight. This can be used to player's advantage with smaller dens, using him as bait. However, with larger dens, it is recommended to leave Chester away from Spiders.
* Since Spiders that fall in battle may also leave behind Monster Meat, Webber can easily pick this up and use it to befriend another spider.
* It is advised to befriend [Cave Spiders](/wiki/Cave_Spider "Cave Spider") and [Spitters](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter") for one's personal army. While Webber and the Cave Spiders can tank the enemy, Spitters can decimate them from afar, away from danger.
* Befriended Spider Warriors can be used to easily hunt small animals ([Butterflies](/wiki/Butterflies "Butterflies"), [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbits "Rabbits"), etc.) as their jump attack has enough range to kill small prey before they can run.
* If the player disconnects from a server with befriended Spiders, any Spiders who managed to stay within the vicinity of where they disconnected will stay befriended. Though caution should be taken as while the player is not in the server they will not be befriended, and thus will attack any non-Webber players nearby, or simply wander away.
* To order a Spider to attack another Spider, press the hotkey for attacking an enemy (For example, "F" on keyboard) before immediately moving the character to cancel the attack. If it is done too fast, nothing will happen. If done too slow, the player will end up attacking the spider, and some spiders will try to retaliate. If timed just right, Webber will say his battle line despite the attack not landing, thus inciting the allied Spider(s) without drawing any risk to Webber.
* To safely and easily collect large amounts of Monster Meat, Silk, and Spider Glands, players can use the following technique:
  1. Plant multiple Spider Dens in a small area.
  2. When Spiders are wandering around during the dusk/night, feed one a piece of Meat and order it to attack another Spider.
  3. This will cause all of the Spiders nearby to swarm the offending follower.
  4. This will cause a war between the Spiders, causing all nearby Spiders to attack each other.
