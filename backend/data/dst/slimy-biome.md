The 'Slimy Biome' (or 'Cave Exit Biome') is a [biome](/wiki/Biome "Biome") that can only be found in the [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves"). The ground is covered with [Slimy Turf](/wiki/Slimy_Turf "Slimy Turf") as the name suggests.

The 10 staircases are always in this biome. The bottom of each will be in the center of a large [Cave Light](/wiki/Cave_Light "Cave Light") and have a few [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tufts "Grass Tufts"), [Evergreens](/wiki/Evergreen "Evergreen"), [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") and/or [Twiggy Trees](/wiki/Twiggy_Tree "Twiggy Tree"). There will also be at least a few [Light Flowers](/wiki/Light_Flower "Light Flower") and [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushroom "Mushroom") nearby and maybe even some [Fireflies](/wiki/Fireflies "Fireflies"). Smaller Cave Lights occasionally dot this biome and are associated with many of the set pieces found here.

The (mostly non-functional) cave version of the [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern") is always in a room in the Slimy Biome. It is surrounded by grass, twigs, and trees, much like an exit stair, but a little larger, with more items.

This biome forms a series of tuberculate branching rooms, like a child's drawing of a bunch of balloons where the strings (rocky passageways) connect to each balloon (slimy turf room) at one end, and converge into a single passage or different biome at the other end. Slimy biomes are always terminal (no biome can be connected to their far end) and each contains 1-4 staircases depending on their size. The converging passages all eventually connect up to the [Waste](/wiki/Waste "Waste") in the center of the caves, but often pass through the various other cave biomes on the way. Extremely rarely, they may connect directly to the [Lichen Meadow](/wiki/Lichen_Meadow "Lichen Meadow"), but this may be a bug.

Most of this area is fairly sparse and homogeneous, but it's broken up by mini-biomes or set pieces. Lone bunny hutches and the occasional [Rabbit town or city](/wiki/Bunnyman#Communities "Bunnyman") can be found here as well as occasional [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den").

Mini-biomes or set pieces found here including several [Sunken Forests](/wiki/Sunken_Forest "Sunken Forest") and related areas.
