**The Tome of Beckoning** is an item added to *[The Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge")* in *Don't Starve Together* (an unlockable item in the 2018 Crucible). Drops on wave 9.

This item is a melee weapon. When attacking, a character swings the tome and deals 15 damage to the target.

The Tome of Beckoning's main ability is for calling upon Magma Golems. When used, a [Magma Golem](/wiki/Magma_Golem "Magma Golem") is summoned.

## Prototype Tips[]

* The only characters able to use the summon tome are Ms. Wickerbottom and Maxwell. If a team wishes to use this booklet, one of them must be chosen before the start of the round.
* Wickerbottom's empowered spell makes the golem more powerful: the elemental deals 38 damage per shot.
* If Wickerbottom or Maxwell are using an infernal staff, they can sometimes pick up a tome of summoning to summon a golem, then continue throwing fireballs left and right.
