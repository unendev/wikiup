Red Mushrooms during Daytime

 

[Red Mushrooms](/wiki/Red_Mushroom "Red Mushroom") can be found in [Grassland](/wiki/Grassland "Grassland") or [Forest](/wiki/Forest "Forest") biomes and can be easily identified by their red cap. They are only harvestable during [Daytime](/wiki/Day "Day"), during [night](/wiki/Night "Night") and [dusk](/wiki/Dusk "Dusk") they will bury themselves underground.

## Green Mushroom[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/0/08/Green %27shrooms.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130828155116 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/0/08/Green %27shrooms.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130828155116 

Green Mushrooms during Dusk

 

[Green Mushrooms](/wiki/Green_Mushroom "Green Mushroom") can be found in [Forests](/wiki/Forests "Forests"), [Savannas](/wiki/Savanna "Savanna") and [Marshes](/wiki/Marshes "Marshes") and can be easily identified by their green caps. They are only harvestable during Dusk; during [Day](/wiki/Day "Day") and [Night](/wiki/Night "Night") they will bury themselves underground.

## Blue Mushroom[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/5d/Blue %27shrooms.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130828160135 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/5d/Blue %27shrooms.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130828160135 

Blue Mushrooms during Night

 

[Blue Mushrooms](/wiki/Blue_Mushroom "Blue Mushroom") can be found in [Forests](/wiki/Forest "Forest") and [Marshes](/wiki/Marshes "Marshes") and can be easily identified by their blue caps. They are only harvestable during Night; during Day and Dusk they will bury themselves underground.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/d/d8/Shrooms.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130828151439 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/d/d8/Shrooms.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130828151439 

"Sunken" Mushrooms

 

A buried mushroom cannot be harvested like normal but it can be dug up using the [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel"). Digging up a buried mushroom will produce 2 Caps of the respective mushroom but it will also prevent more mushrooms from growing. If not dug up, a mushroom will regrow shortly after the next [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain").

## Mushtrees[]

[Mushtrees](/wiki/Mushtrees "Mushtrees") are organisms that can only be found in [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") or during the full moon on the surface in *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")*. Mushtrees are, as their name indicates, a mixture between [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms") and [Trees](/wiki/Trees "Trees"). Unlike "normal" mushrooms, Mushtrees cannot be picked or dug up, they have to be chopped down with an [Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe"). Upon being chopped they will drop the respective loot depending on which kind of Mushtree it was. Just like the mushrooms there are three types of Mushtrees; [Red Mushtree](/wiki/Red_Mushtree "Red Mushtree"), [Green Mushtree](/wiki/Green_Mushtree "Green Mushtree"), and [Blue Mushtree](/wiki/Mushtrees "Mushtrees"). When a Mushtree is set on fire, it will burn to a crisp and then disappear dropping one [Ash](/wiki/Ashes "Ashes") and one [Charcoal](/wiki/Charcoal "Charcoal"). In addition to that all mushtrees provide light.

### [Red Mushtree](/wiki/Tree/Mushtree#Red "Tree/Mushtree")[]

After being being chopped down the Red Mushtree will drop one [Log](/wiki/Log "Log") and one [Red Cap](/wiki/Red_Cap "Red Cap").

### [Green Mushtree](/wiki/Tree/Mushtree#Green "Tree/Mushtree")[]

After being chopped down the Green Mushtree will drop one [Log](/wiki/Log "Log") and one [Green Cap](/wiki/Green_Cap "Green Cap").

### [Blue Mushtree](/wiki/Tree/Mushtree#Blue "Tree/Mushtree")[]

The Blue Mushtree is the biggest Mushtree and will drop two [logs](/wiki/Logs "Logs") and one [Blue Cap](/wiki/Blue_Cap "Blue Cap").

* Has the most positive effects when raw, can come in handy to increase [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") as well as [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger").
* Slightly increases your [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") and is therefore another possibility to counteract the raw [Green Mushroom](/wiki/Green_Mushroom "Green Mushroom").

## Tips and Hints[]

* Mushrooms are outstanding for decreasing your [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") in order to farm [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel"). The best way to use them is to have couple of one that noticeably decreases your sanity, such as the raw green mushroom and another one to increase your Sanity or your [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") when the situation gets out of control and too dangerous. A good choice can be cooked green caps or raw blue caps.
* Simply place a [Red Cap](/wiki/Red_Cap "Red Cap") somewhere near a Gobbler and wait until it eats the cap. As the eating of an uncooked red mushroom decreases the [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") of any creature by 20, since Gobblers have 50 HP, eating 3 raw red caps will kill them.
* Additionally all mushrooms are considered [Vegetables](/wiki/Vegetables "Vegetables") and have a [Food](/wiki/Foods "Foods") value of 0.5. You can use them as vegetables in the [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot"). In this case the [Red Mushroom](/wiki/Red_Mushroom "Red Mushroom") is pretty handy because in raw condition its only positive effect is the one on your hunger, but since farming them requires a fairly high investment of time (see above: "regrows shortly after it rains") you should just use this mushroom for your food on occasion...
* In particular, 3 mushrooms and 1 [Monster](/wiki/Monster_Meats "Monster Meats") Meat will still make [Meatballs](/wiki/Meatballs "Meatballs"). In this way, you can turn 4 harmful foods into one decent meal- this is best for the easy to obtain red mushrooms that are too harmful to eat cooked or raw. However, this is primarily for hunger. If you need sanity/health you are best bet is to either eat cooked greens (for sanity) or alternate raw blues (for health) and/or cooked greens (to offset sanity loss of raw blue).
* Another problem with farming mushrooms is that they spoil very fast, so the best way to use them is to have some near your base to collect them every now and then, or to mark their locations on the map by simply placing [Signs](/wiki/Sign "Sign"), the [Backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack"), [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree"), [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling"), [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), and other stuff.
* Like most of the other plants (although mushrooms aren't actually plants, I know), mushrooms do not regrow during winter since it is technically a "dry" season due to snow instead of rain: snow doesn't hydrate the mushrooms.
* You should think twice before digging a mushroom. Was eliminating the mushroom spawner forever worth the two caps? You should only make use of this option when it's unavoidable or you're in need of the particular mushroom, especially in Adventure Mode where Sanity management is a priority.
* Eating an uncooked [Blue Mushroom](/wiki/Blue_Mushroom "Blue Mushroom") gives you -15 Sanity and +20 Health. Eating a cooked [Green Mushroom](/wiki/Green_Mushroom "Green Mushroom") however gives you +15 Sanity and -1 Health. If you have stacks of these, quick passage through [Obelisks](/wiki/Obelisks "Obelisks") shouldn't be a problem any more.
