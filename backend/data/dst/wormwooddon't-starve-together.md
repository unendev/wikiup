*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Wormwood Filter](/wiki/Wormwood_Filter "Wormwood Filter")*

Wormwood's main perk is access to the exclusive [Wormwood Filter](/wiki/Wormwood_Filter "Wormwood Filter"). This gives him the ability to craft 4 items that cannot be crafted by any other character.

The Wormwood Filter items are:

* **[Living Log](/wiki/Living_Log "Living Log")** - When crafted, Wormwood will lose 20 Health.
* **[Bramble Husk](/wiki/Bramble_Husk "Bramble Husk")** - Provides protection when worn, causes all [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") around Wormwood to take damage when he is hit, and prevents damage from Bramble Traps. Wearing it also makes [Cactus](/wiki/Cactus "Cactus") and [Spiky Bushes](/wiki/Spiky_Bush "Spiky Bush") totally harmless so that picking them deals no damage the player, or wear to the husk.
* **[Bramble Trap](/wiki/Bramble_Trap "Bramble Trap")** - Behaves similarly to a [Tooth Trap](/wiki/Tooth_Trap "Tooth Trap"), dealing less damage but in a radius around the trap rather than to one target.
* **[Compost Wrap](/wiki/Compost_Wrap "Compost Wrap")** - Restores 40 Health (8 instantly and 32 over 32 seconds).

With an addition of [Insight](/wiki/Insight "Insight") Skills:

* **[Lunar Sapling](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling")**
* [**Berry Bush**](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush")
* **[Juicy Berry Bush](/wiki/Juicy_Berry_Bush "Juicy Berry Bush")**
* **[Monkeytails](/wiki/Monkeytails "Monkeytails")**
* [**Lureplant**](/wiki/Meat_Bulb_(Lureplant) "Meat Bulb (Lureplant)")
* **[Syrup of Ipecaca](/wiki/Syrup_of_Ipecaca "Syrup of Ipecaca")**
* [**Carrats**](/wiki/Carrat "Carrat")
* [**Bulbous Lightbugs**](/wiki/Bulbous_Lightbug "Bulbous Lightbug")
* [**Saladmanders**](/wiki/Saladmander "Saladmander")

Wormwood also has a number of other perks, chief of which is the ability to plant [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") and [Plant Seeds](/wiki/Plant_Seeds "Plant Seeds") without the need of a [Garden Digamajig](/wiki/Garden_Digamajig "Garden Digamajig") or [Garden Hoe](/wiki/Garden_Hoe "Garden Hoe"). These seeds can be planted on most turfs, excluding things such as [Rocky](/wiki/Rocky_Turf "Rocky Turf") Turf. Plants planted by Wormwood (either using his perk or just planting seeds into hoe holes) stay fresh in the ground 1.5 times longer than planted by anyone else.

Wormwood also gains 10 Sanity from planting. This includes [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") and [Crop Seeds](/wiki/Crop_Seeds "Crop Seeds") planted on the ground or on a [Farm Plant](/wiki/Farm_Plant "Farm Plant") planting [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft"), [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling"), [Spiky Bushes](/wiki/Spiky_Bush "Spiky Bush"), [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms") in a [Mushroom Planter](/wiki/Mushroom_Planter "Mushroom Planter"), or [Tree](/wiki/Tree "Tree") seeds.

[Eyeplants](/wiki/Eyeplant "Eyeplant") are neutral towards him. Harvesting [Sea Weeds](/wiki/Sea_Weed "Sea Weed") won't make them wake up and attack him. Wormwood is also immune to effects of [Fire Nettles](/wiki/Fire_Nettles "Fire Nettles") and [Spiny Bindweed](/wiki/Spiny_Bindweed "Spiny Bindweed").

No [Food](/wiki/Food "Food") item will change his health in any way, so items such as raw [Red Caps](/wiki/Red_Cap "Red Cap") or [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy") can be consumed without taking any damage.

Wormwood doesn't suffer a sanity drain for being [Wet](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") or for equipping wet items, but the temperature loss induced by wetness remains unchanged.

Wormwood can also fertilize himself with [Fertilizers](/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient"). He gains instant heal based on Manure [Nutrient](/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient") value and he gains heal over time based on Compost nutrient value. The Growth Formula nutrient triggers blooming, applying more formula fertilizer will increase rate at which Bloomness is accumulated and extend the duration when fully bloomed.

## Bloomness[]

There are three stages of growth, before blooming, followed by the three stages again in reverse as blooming subsides

Wormwood starts at Stage 0, with an empty bloomness pool and no bloomness gain. However, once [Spring](/wiki/Seasons/Spring "Seasons/Spring") starts or [Growth Formula fertilizers](/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient") are applied (such as Glommer's Goop), Wormwood enters Stage 1. Here, he begins gaining bloomness at a particular rate, which is influenced by both the current season and the accumulated fertilizer.

In Stage 1, Wormwood's default bloomness gain is 1 bloomness per 1 second. The exact bloomness gain formula is as follows:

**rate = season\_multiplier x (1 + (fertilizer\_storage x 1/128))**

The *season\_multiplier* represents the season's influence on bloomness gain, with different seasons having varying multipliers:

* Autumn: 1x
* Winter: 0.75x
* Spring: 1.5x
* Summer: 1x

The *fertilizer\_storage* refers to the cumulative amount of growth formula nutrient that have been applied thus far. Their values are as follows:

* Growth Formula Starter: 8
* Fermenting Growth Formula: 16
* Fermented Growth Formula: 32
* Super Growth Formula: 32
* Spoiled Fish: 16
* Spoiled Fish Morsel: 8
* Compost Wrap: 24
* Glommer's Goop: 8

To move from Stage 1 to Stage 2, Wormwood needs to accumulate a total of 480 Bloomness (432 with Growth Spurt IGrowth Spurt I, 360 with Growth Spurt IIGrowth Spurt II). With the rate of 1 this translates to the number of seconds, 480 equals one full in game day. Once he reaches Stage 2, both his rate and bloomness are reset, and the process starts anew.

Upon entering Stage 3, which is the final stage, Wormwood's bloomness amount is immediately set to 1440, equivalent to 3 full in-game days at rate of 1 (2160 or 4.5 days with Flower PowerFlower Power). The rate no longer increases with fertilizer application. In fact, the rate is set to -1, meaning that bloomness is actually lost over time. However during spring, the rate becomes 0, effectively pausing the bloomness counter, while in winter, the rate turns to -2, resulting in even more bloomness loss.

Stage 3 brings the possibility of accumulating more bloomness than ever before. The meter can hold up to 2400 bloomness, equivalent to 5 full in-game days at rate of 1 (3600 or 7.5 days with Flower PowerFlower Power). Fertilizer application no longer influences the rate, instead it adds flat amount to the total bloomness as per following formula:

**flat\_bloomness = growth\_formula\_nutrient x 7.5**

Meaning 5 uses [Super Growth Formula](/wiki/Growth_Formula_Starter "Growth Formula Starter") will provide 1200 bloomness in total (7.5 x 32= 240 bloomness per use)

In Stage 3, the accumulation of fertilizers halts. Each time you apply a new one, only the amount of that specific fertilizer is included in the calculations. No longer are the previous amounts accumulated.

Wormwood also increases Bloomness gain rate (and flat Bloomness in stage 3) when exposed to [Acid Rain](/wiki/Acid_Rain "Acid Rain"). To calculate gain, value of damage caused by Acid Rain is used as *fertilizer\_storage* and *growth\_formula\_nutrient* in the formulas mentioned above.

Each stages gives a movement speed multiplier and hunger drain multiplier, linearly scaling from 1 to 1.2

| Stage | Duration | Movement speed & Hunger drain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | ongoing | +0% |
| 1 | 1 day | +6% |
| 2 | 1 day | +13% |
| 3 | 3-5 days | +20% |

When in full bloom (Stage 3), Wormwood tends all [Farm Plant](/wiki/Farm_Plant "Farm Plant") within a 1 tile radius around him.

During the third stage of blooming, Wormwood's flower will open up and a small particle effect of pollen will begin to fall from his head. In addition to this, everywhere he steps in this form will begin to grow small tufts of grass and flowers. This trail of flowers and grass is more than cosmetic, however, and will attract Bees, Grumble Bees, and Bee Queens. Bees and Killer Bees are neutral to Wormwood unless provoked, while he is blooming. Caution should still be taken in close proximity to other players. The bees may play the animation as though pollinating these flowers, but they will not generate honey using them. It should be noted that while the flowers are only visible during the peak of Wormwood's blooming phase, Bees are attracted to him throughout all of Spring season. Wormwood gains 60 [Overheating protection](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") while fully blooming (180 with Shade PlantShade Plant).

## Disadvantages[]

As said above, Food items will neither increase nor decrease Wormwood's health. This limits the usefulness of items such as [Dragonpie](/wiki/Dragonpie "Dragonpie") and [Pierogi](/wiki/Pierogi "Pierogi"), restricting him to non-edible healing items such as (only more potent items shown here):

| Item | Healing | Time | Extra |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Bat Bat](/wiki/Bat_Bat "Bat Bat") | 510 | +6.8 health per hit | Deals Damage, Drains sanity |
| [Life Giving Amulet](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet") | 100 | Over 10 minutes | Trades 5 hunger for 5 health every 30 seconds. Resurrection. Sanity effects. |
| [Siesta Lean-to](/wiki/Siesta_Lean-to "Siesta Lean-to") | 60 (variable) | +2/second | Each second: sanity +1, wetness -1, hunger +1, body temperature -1 (down to 40). Daytime only. |
| [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent") | 60 (variable) | +2/second | Each second: sanity +1, wetness -1, hunger +0.33, body temperature +1 (up to 40). Dusk and night only. |
| [Compost Wrap](/wiki/Compost_Wrap "Compost Wrap") | 40 | Over 32 seconds | Initiates bloom. Fertilizer |
| [Tree Jam](/wiki/Tree_Jam "Tree Jam") | 34 | Over 32 seconds | Initiates bloom. Boat repair. Fertilizer |
| [Honey Poultice](/wiki/Honey_Poultice "Honey Poultice") | 30 | Instant | Heals mobs |
| [Healing Salve](/wiki/Healing_Salve "Healing Salve") | 20 | Instant |  |

See [Nutrient](/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient") Fertilizer section for additional (less-potent) healing options.

In addition, Wormwood loses Sanity when killing plants:

* -5 Sanity from chopping a tree or picking a [Flower](/wiki/Flower "Flower").
* -5 Sanity from digging up tree stumps, Grass Tufts, Saplings, or Farm Plants

Burning trees, chopping burned trees, harvesting plants, or pulling carrots carries no penalty in DST.

Wormwood takes 25% more damage from fire, and burns for 1 second longer (4.4 seconds in total).

## Tips[]

* In DST Wormwood's [favorite food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Cooked Banana](/wiki/Banana#Cooked_Banana "Banana"), meaning he gains 15 bonus Hunger when consuming the food.
* Using his ability to grow large amounts of food, Wormwood can sleep in a [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent") or [Siesta Lean-to](/wiki/Siesta_Lean-to "Siesta Lean-to") to regenerate large amounts of health all while still having food to spare.
* Wormwood's abilities can greatly aid [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly"). Wormwood's ability to plant seeds allow Warly to access powerful items & Dishes like [Grim Galette](/wiki/Grim_Galette "Grim Galette") or [Garlic Powder](/wiki/Garlic_Powder "Garlic Powder"). Said items can compensate for Wormwood's inability to heal from food.
* Because of his high sanity variability, Wormwood can easily use equipment like the [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword"), [Bat Bat](/wiki/Bat_Bat "Bat Bat") and especially the [Night Armor](/wiki/Night_Armor "Night Armor"). Lost Sanity can easily be re-obtained. Otherwise, Wormwood can quickly induce himself high insanity if need be.
* In DST, Wormwood works well with Wortox, as souls can heal him.
* Although Eyeplants are neutral to him using force attack still targets them. Caution is advised.
* You can craft a Bucket-O-Poop and use it to heal more than you would with the initial 3 Manure.
* In DST, blooming effect by growth formula can be stacked up to 4 days.
* Since [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") don't need to be fertilized, and planting them gives +10 Sanity while digging them up only gives -5 Sanity, Wormwood can easily gain Sanity by repeatedly digging up and re-planting the same Sapling for a net +5 each time.
* Though Wormwood can control his sanity completely through planting and chopping/digging/picking things, he can end up in situations without sufficient seeds/shovels. It is still sometimes more practical or even necessary to restore sanity with food or other standard means.
