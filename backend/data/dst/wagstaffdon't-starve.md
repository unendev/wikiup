*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Tinkering Tab](/wiki/Tinkering_Tab "Tinkering Tab")*

Wagstaff has access to his own [Crafting](/wiki/Crafting "Crafting") tab called [Tinkering](/wiki/Tinkering_Tab "Tinkering Tab"), with which he is able to craft different types of goggles and 3 exclusive gadgets. All goggles will remove Wagstaff's nearsighted disadvantage when worn, and each have their own special ability. Additionally, he has an exclusive item in the base game called the [Electrical Doodad](/wiki/Electrical_Doodad "Electrical Doodad"), which is needed to craft several of his other items.

The Tinkering Tab contains the following items that Wagstaff can craft:

* **[Spectoggles](/wiki/Spectoggles "Spectoggles")** - Basic goggles for general use to negate nearsightedness and is used as an ingredient to craft other goggles. Can be used to reveal hidden dangers or secrets. Has a durability of 10 days.
* **[Infroggles](/wiki/Infroggles "Infroggles")** - Lets Wagstaff see the world in an infrared view. Can be used to avoid being attacked by [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") and lasts for 2 days.
* **[Visor](/wiki/Visor "Visor")** - Absorbs 85% of physical damage and has a durability of 600. An overlay will partially block the edges of the player's screen while worn, making these goggles impractical to wear outside of combat.
* **[Fryfocals](/wiki/Fryfocals "Fryfocals")** - Shoots a fireball when Wagstaff attacks a target while equipping nothing in the hand slot. Each fireball deals 50 damage on impact and sets the victim on fire. The durability of these goggles is only reduced when firing them, meaning the player can potentially wear them forever to negate being nearsighted. Has 10 uses.
* **[Telebrella](/wiki/Telebrella "Telebrella")** - Short-ranged teleportation device that will teleport Wagstaff to the nearest Telipad assuming the player is within range. The Telebrella has a limited range away from the receiving Telipad where it can be used. If the player ventures too far away from a Telipad, they cannot teleport. It has 10 uses.
* **[Telipad](/wiki/Telipad "Telipad")** - The receiver pad for the Telebrella that is placed on the ground. Wagstaff will teleport to the nearest Telipad when using a Telebrella and is close enough. If more than one Telipad exists and the player is standing on one of them, they will be teleported to the next closest Telipad. This allows the player to teleport back and forth between two points of the world.
* **[Thumper](/wiki/Thumper "Thumper")** - A large device that slams the ground when activated and creates a shockwave that destroys [Structures](/wiki/Structures "Structures") and [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree"), and does 30 damage to [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") and the player should they be within range.

Another advantage of Wagstaff is his massive amount of 225 [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") points, which gives him the possibility to survive without food for 3 days from a full belly before starving.

## Disadvantages[]

Wagstaff is nearsighted, which means that without his goggles he is unable to see beyond 4 units of distance. Outside of his line-of-sight, everything will appear blurry. When hovering over a blurry object with the cursor, the object will be given a random name. He has a set of examination quotes just for blurry objects, all variations on how he cannot determine what the object is. Staying warm and keeping sanity up may be difficult as goggles take up the head slot and are required to be worn at all times if the player wants to see clearly.

He also has a "delicate stomach", and will take 3 damage from eating raw or dried [Food](/wiki/Food "Food").

In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC, all of Wagstaff's exclusive headwear grants protection from [Humid Season](/wiki/Seasons/Humid "Seasons/Humid")'s [Fog](/wiki/Fog "Fog"), allowing him to move at full speed. In addition, his Spectoggles allow him to identify [Peculiar Objects](/wiki/Peculiar_Objects "Peculiar Objects").

## Prototype Tips[]

* A good place to base as Wagstaff is at the [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King"), as the [pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") can be killed for both [Pig Skin](/wiki/Pig_Skin "Pig Skin"), used to make Spectoggles, and meat to give to the Pig King for [Gold](/wiki/Gold "Gold"), which is also used to craft Spectoggles.
* The Fryfocals will not lose durability when equipped and not used in combat, so not using them as a weapon can effectively give you unlimited sight if you don't mind the yellow overlay it gives.
  + The Visor can also be used for unlimited sight, so long as you are not attacked and don't mind the vision reduction.
* The Telipad and Telebrella can make for easy travel between islands in *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* and especially *Hamlet* worlds.
* The Thumper is an effective way to indirectly kill neutral mobs, such as [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo"), [Royal Guards](/wiki/Royal_Guard "Royal Guard"), or even [Moslings](/wiki/Mosling "Mosling").
* The Thumper's prominent use is to farm trees by planting a bunch of them near the Thumper, waiting for them to grow, and then activating it to harvest all the trees at once.
* The Spectoggles can be used in a base game or *Reign of Giants* world to detect hiding [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle") from anywhere on the screen. also in *Shipwrecked*, it will detect hiding [Flup](/wiki/Flup "Flup") too.
