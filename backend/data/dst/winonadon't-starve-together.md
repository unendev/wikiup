These are special abilities unique to Winona.

* When her hunger is above 50, she spends 5 hunger to start a crafting streak, which can [craft](/wiki/Crafting "Crafting") items & structures at twice the speed as other Characters, finishing one craft in 0.5 seconds. her crafting streak lasts 1 minute , or when she is standing still, since her last craft. On the other hand, if her hunger is at most 50, she crafts at half the speed, taking 2 seconds but does not cost hunger to craft.

* She can properly identify [Wagstaff's](/wiki/Grainy_Transmission "Grainy Transmission") tools during the [Moonstorm](/wiki/Moonstorm "Moonstorm") event.

## Prototype Tips[]

* Using her Trusty Tape, she can effectively repair Clothing items where there are no [Hounds](/wiki/Hound "Hound"). This makes her a useful asset when [spelunking](/wiki/Caves "Caves").
* [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") can easily supply Winona the [Silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk") she needs to make her Trusty Tape, making its single use less of a problem.
* The Trusty Tape is especially useful for surviving tougher [Seasons](/wiki/Seasons "Seasons"), as some clothing items used to delay [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing")/[Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") are not durable enough to survive an entire [winter](/wiki/Seasons/Winter "Seasons/Winter")/[summer](/wiki/Seasons/Summer "Seasons/Summer") season.
* Her increased crafting speed is also helpful when dodging or fleeing (e.g. being chased by a group of [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider"), Shadow [Splumonkeys](/wiki/Splumonkey "Splumonkey") or [Terrorbeaks](/wiki/Terrorbeak "Terrorbeak")). It's much easier to find the shorter time window to craft a new torch or weapon when dodging or in pursuit.
* The free hit from the dark refreshes *each time one enters light*, so using it a few special tricks are performable.
  + [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch") swapping, or only holding a light only when absolutely needed becomes easier, and one needs to fear getting hit much less, one can even take the first hit and only hold the light when the second hit is about to come.
  + Because one can stay in the dark much longer, darkness is more of an opportunity for her to lower [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") at much less risk than any other character.
  + If one is out of light or needs to find/craft a light source, the dodged hit from the dark compounds with her increased [Crafting](/wiki/Crafting "Crafting") speed when above fifty hunger to allow more time to craft a new light source, greatly increasing the odds of survival in such a scenario.
* Winona's [favorite food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Spicy Vegetable Stinger](/wiki/Spicy_Vegetable_Stinger "Spicy Vegetable Stinger"), meaning that she gains 15 bonus Hunger when the food is consumed.
