Currently there are two characters that promote nomadic play: [Walani](/wiki/Walani "Walani") and [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly"). Depending on which character you pick, you may have different priorities on what to build when making your home base.

This strategy involves creating a main base, and smaller bases (which we will call docks). Due to the fact that all the materials in making a [Chiminea](/wiki/Chiminea "Chiminea") are all feasibly renewable (although a shortage for flint and gold is eventually going to happen) you should at least build one Chiminea per island, more for bigger islands. A chest in each dock is a must, to store all necessary fuel and other needed supplies.
