Wickerbottom reading the "The End Is Nigh" book

 

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Books](/wiki/Books "Books")*

**Wickerbottom's** special power is a [Crafting](/wiki/Crafting/Don%27t_Starve "Crafting/Don't Starve") tab called [Books](/wiki/Books "Books"). This gives her the ability to craft 5 different magical books with [Papyrus](/wiki/Papyrus "Papyrus") and other different ingredients. She can read these for beneficial effects, but at the cost of a lot of [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity").

The Books that she can craft are:

* **[Birds of the World](/wiki/Birds_of_the_World "Birds of the World")**- When read, this Book will summon 20-30 [Birds](/wiki/Birds "Birds") in a circle around Wickerbottom.
* **[Applied Horticulture](/wiki/Applied_Horticulture "Applied Horticulture")**- When read, most [Plants](/wiki/Plants "Plants") and [Farms](/wiki/Farm "Farm") around Wickerbottom will advance to the next stage of their growth.
* **[Sleepytime Stories](/wiki/Sleepytime_Stories "Sleepytime Stories")** - When read, this Book acts the same as a [Pan Flute](/wiki/Pan_Flute "Pan Flute"), putting all nearby [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") to sleep.
* **[On Tentacles](/wiki/On_Tentacles "On Tentacles")** - When read, this Book will summon 3 [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacles "Tentacles") at random locations near Wickerbottom.
* **[The End is Nigh](/wiki/The_End_is_Nigh "The End is Nigh")**- When read, this Book will summon 16 [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") strikes at random locations near Wickerbottom.

The Books can be read a maximum of 5 times each and drain 33 or 50 Sanity with each reading session. This is somewhat offset by Wickerbottom's higher maximum Sanity, but eventually some [Sanity restoring](/wiki/Category:Sanity_Boost "Category:Sanity Boost") means will be required for continued usage of the Books.

Wickerbottom can make all [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") recipes without having to build the Science Machine, but does not gain the 15 Sanity per prototype for those since she already knows them at the start of the game. The rest of the recipes can be prototyped with a Science Machine even though they would normally require an Alchemy Engine. Therefore, only a Science Machine is needed to unlock all Science recipes for prototyping. The one exception is the book "On Tentacles" - she needs an Alchemy Engine to prototype it. This free tier of knowledge does not apply to [Magic](/wiki/Magic_Tab "Magic Tab") research machines.

Wickerbottom is suited for both early and late game playthroughs, providing an easy start with her knowledge and interesting strategies with her Books in the later days.

## Disadvantage[]

Wickerbottom lacks the ability to sleep in a [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent"), [Bed Roll](/wiki/Bed_Roll "Bed Roll"), or [Fur Roll](/wiki/Fur_Roll "Fur Roll") due to her being an insomniac. This means that crafting those Items and [Structures](/wiki/Structures "Structures") would be a waste of resources and the player will need other means to restore Sanity.

She also hates spoiled Food, causing her Sanity to suffer greatly. Eating stale food costs her no Sanity, but neither does it restore any. Stale Food also restores less Hunger and less Health than fresh Food of the same type. Raw Food has no penalties outside of its normal ones (e.g. [Green Caps](/wiki/Green_Cap "Green Cap")) if it is fresh.

| **Stage** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| **Green (Fresh)** | Restores the full amount of Hunger, Health and Sanity for a given Food |
| **Yellow (Stale)** | Restores 1/3 (normally 2/3) of Hunger, 1/4 (normally 1/3) of Health for a given food and doesn't restore any Sanity |
| **Red (Spoiled)** | Restores 1/6 (normally 1/2) of Hunger for a given food, doesn't restore any Health and decreases Sanity by 10 |

## Downloadable Content[]

In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* (RoG), *Don't Starve Together* and *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* (SW) DLCs, Wickerbottom will be unable to sleep in the [Siesta Lean-to](/wiki/Siesta_Lean-to "Siesta Lean-to").

In *Shipwrecked*, due to the lack of Tentacles in the world, the "On Tentacles" Book has been replaced with **[Joy of Volcanology](/wiki/Books "Books")**. When read, this Book will summon 4 [Dragoon Eggs](/wiki/Dragoon_Egg "Dragoon Egg") to fall at her location, dealing massive [Fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire") damage. Players can still craft and use "On Tentacles" but only if they use the [Seaworthy](/wiki/Seaworthy "Seaworthy") and travel to a non-Shipwrecked world.

## Tips[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 See also: [Guides/Character guide - Wickerbottom's Books](/wiki/Guides/Character_guide_-_Wickerbottom%27s_Books "Guides/Character guide - Wickerbottom's Books")*

* During the early days, it is advised to craft a [Backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") and [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel") as soon as possible to start storing dug [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft"), [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") and [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush") for the player's future base, saving them the time to go back and acquire these items.
* Having early access to variety of books is valuable, therefore setting the base in reasonable proximity to Swamps is a good strategy, and visiting Swamps frequently is a requirement to use Books reliably.
* Eating Cooked Green Caps is highly recommended during the early days, as well as going after the [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter") in [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter") and creating [Bee Boxes](/wiki/Bee_Box "Bee Box") for [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy") in later days, in order to get good use out of the Books.
  + https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f8/Reign of Giants icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20140408110712 Eating cooked [Cactus Flesh](/wiki/Cactus_Flesh "Cactus Flesh") is also a good way to quickly restore Sanity, however [Jelly Salad](/wiki/Jelly_Salad "Jelly Salad") is the go-to end game Sanity restoring food considering its easy and cheap recipe and 50 sanity gain.
  + Shipwrecked Different Crock Pot recipes that provide big amounts of Sanity like [Banana Pop](/wiki/Banana_Pop "Banana Pop") and [Surf 'n' Turf](/wiki/Surf_%27n%27_Turf "Surf 'n' Turf").
* "Birds of the World" book allows the player to produce mass amounts of [Feathers](/wiki/Feather "Feather") if it is coupled with "Sleepytime Stories", [Bird Traps](/wiki/Bird_Trap "Bird Trap"), [Lureplants](/wiki/Meat_Bulb_(Lureplant) "Meat Bulb (Lureplant)") or Mobs that will hunt the birds, such as [MacTusk](/wiki/MacTusk "MacTusk") or [Merm](/wiki/Merm "Merm").
* The Lightning from "The End is Nigh" has no tactical use besides charging allied [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, as it deals next to no damage and can stunlock Wickerbottom herself in the middle of combat, while posing the risk of burning valuable items.
* "Sleepytime stories" allows picking easy fights with swarms of mobs such as [Clockwork Monsters](/wiki/Category:Clockwork_Monsters "Category:Clockwork Monsters") or Spiders.
* "Applied Horticulture" allows Wickerbottom to mass-produce crops such as Dragon Fruit.
* "On Tentacles" is generally only useful as tentacle pit spawner which allows the player to easily fight many enemies such as Hounds, Bee Queen, Walrus, Spiders. The downside of this strategy is that it's dangerous and the player probably needs a [Lazy Forager](/wiki/The_Lazy_Forager "The Lazy Forager") to pick up the loot risk-free.
* Shipwrecked "Joy of Volcanology" can be used to easily farm [Obsidian](/wiki/Obsidian "Obsidian") by extinguishing the [Lava Pools](/wiki/Lava_Pool "Lava Pool") that form with [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice").
