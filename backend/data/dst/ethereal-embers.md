| When a creature dies while on fire, they drop an etherial ember of some burnt essence of life.  When Willow attunes with her lighter, eventually she can sense and collect Ethereal Embers with it.  Willow can learn to use embers for a variety of Pyrokinetics. |

**Ethereal Embers** are an [Item](/wiki/Item "Item") exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. They are dropped by [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") when they die while on [Fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire"), except from smaller mobs like [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterfly "Butterfly") or [Birds](/wiki/Birds "Birds"). Ethereal Embers can only be collected by [Willow](/wiki/Willow/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Willow/Don't Starve Together") with her [Lighter](/wiki/Willow%27s_Lighter "Willow's Lighter") when the [Ember Tender](/wiki/Ember_Tender "Ember Tender") skill is unlocked. An Ember can be used to refill the Lighter by 45%.

Unlike [Souls](/wiki/Souls "Souls") Ethereal Embers do not despawn unless left on the ground and the server is restarted. They do not have a limit in Willow's inventory, but can not be stored in containers like [Backpacks](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") or [Chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest"). They stack up to 40 items and can be recollected when dropped on [Death](/wiki/Death "Death").

Willow can use Ethereal Embers to cast spells when one of these skills are unlocked:

* [Spontaneous Combustion](/wiki/Spontaneous_Combustion "Spontaneous Combustion")
* [Fire Ball](/wiki/Fire_Ball "Fire Ball")
* [Burning Frenzy](/wiki/Burning_Frenzy "Burning Frenzy")
* [Shadow Fire-Raiser](/wiki/Shadow_Fire-Raiser "Shadow Fire-Raiser")
* [Lunar Fire-Raiser](/wiki/Lunar_Fire-Raiser "Lunar Fire-Raiser")

## Trivia[]

* Ethereal Embers were introduced in the *[Skill Spotlight: Wigfrid & Willow](/wiki/Skill_Spotlight:_Wigfrid_%26_Willow "Skill Spotlight: Wigfrid & Willow")* update.
* In the beta Ethereal Embers were named "Hot Embers". This was changed with the release to more accurately describe them.
