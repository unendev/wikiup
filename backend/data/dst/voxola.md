The Voxola factory in Sidney, Ohio.

 

**“**What foul product of science is this?**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell")

**Voxola**, short for **Voxola Radio Company**, is an institution that has a strong presence in the lore of the *Don't Starve* franchise. It was founded by [Robert Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff") in Sidney, Ohio where he also established a factory. The factory was destroyed in a fire only days after the production of its PR-76 radios began. The characters [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona"), [Genny](/wiki/Minor_Characters "Minor Characters"), and [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff") all worked at the factory.

The radio as seen in "Forbidden Knowledge"

 

The first instance of the Voxola PR-76 radio appeared in the animated short *[Forbidden Knowledge](/wiki/Wilson#Origin "Wilson")*. This radio, in the possession of Wilson, was used by [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell/NPC "Maxwell/NPC") both as a means of verbal communication and as a way to channel the "forbidden knowledge" into Wilson's brain.

The radio first appeared in-game in *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* as a primary component of the [Divining Rod](/wiki/Divining_Rod "Divining Rod"). In this form, it broadcasts a sound that increases in intensity the closer the player approaches a [Thing](/wiki/Thing "Thing"), [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing"), or [Maxwell's Door](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door"). The Divining Rod is required to activate the Wooden Thing in order to move from world to world in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"), and it ultimately acts as the key to Maxwell's release from the [Nightmare Throne](/wiki/Nightmare_Throne "Nightmare Throne").

In April 2013, around the time of the Divining Rod's inclusion, developer Kevin Forbes posted on the forums "on the fly" the following lore regarding the radio's inception.[[1]](#cite_note-1) This is also the first mentions of Wagstaff, Voxola, and the factory.

> "The radio is a Voxola PR-76, manufactured in 1919 by the Voxola Radio company of Sidney, Ohio. The radio offered revolutionary sound and reception quality for the time, and was promoted by an intense national marketing campaign. Very few units were actually produced, because the factory was destroyed in a fire only days after production began. Voxola founder [Robert Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff") went missing the night of the fire, and the company declared bankruptcy soon thereafter."

In *[Next of Kin](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Next_of_Kin "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*, it was revealed that the destruction of the factory was not due to a normal fire, but was initiated through the activation of a portal to the [Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant") built by Wagstaff. It was also revealed that Wagstaff and Winona disappeared that night by being brought through that same portal, Wagstaff by unknown means and Winona by being tricked and pulled in by [Shadow Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie").

In *[Constant Companion](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Constant_Companion "Animated Shorts and Trailers"),* [Walter](/wiki/Walter "Walter") encountered a PR-76 radio in [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie")'s abandoned cabin. The [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium") entry for this event says "it is a trap that had lain dormant for years". Upon turning the knob, shadow hands appeared and grabbed Walter, taking him into the Constant.

## PlaceholderTrivia[]

* In real life, there was a radio company called Voxola Manufacturing Company located in New York City.[[2]](#cite_note-2)
* The product name of the Voxola, PR-76, has a similar naming convention to that of [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78").
* Winona was first implied to have worked at the Voxola factory through her unimplemented [examination lines](/wiki/Winona_quotes "Winona quotes") for *Don't Starve* exclusive objects. She recognizes the Voxola on the Divining Rod,[[3]](#cite_note-3) and says that the Divining Rod Base reminds her of "the bossman's workshop."[[4]](#cite_note-4) Winona's experience with the destruction of the factory was revealed through the animated short *Next of Kin*.
  + In Winona's original speech file, her examination quote for the unlocked Divining Rod Holder was "Is... this how the bossman disappeared?"[[5]](#cite_note-5) which may be a reference to the disappearance of Robert Wagstaff. This quote was later changed to "At least I assembled this right."
* In the *[Reap What You Sow](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Return_of_Them:_Reap_What_You_Sow "Animated Shorts and Trailers")* trailer, [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes") uses a PR-76 while attending to some [Farm Plants](/wiki/Farm_Plant "Farm Plant").
