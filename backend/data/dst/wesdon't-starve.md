### [Code](/wiki/Console "Console")

`"wes"`

Wes's special power is his Pile o' Balloons. It has unlimited uses, and it costs 5 Sanity to inflate each Balloon.

When a Balloon is attacked, it explodes, dealing 5 damage to anything nearby (including Wes). Balloons can also trigger other Balloons to explode, allowing Wes to generate chain reactions. Balloons can also be used as decoys or to distract [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs").

## Disadvantages[]

Wes's Hunger drains 25% faster than normal, he deals 25% less damage, and all of his stats are 25% lower than the average survivor.

Wes does not speak, so there are no actual words that show up on the screen, warning the player of incoming attacks or other pertinent information such as when night is approaching, low Hunger levels. The player will only be able to rely on audio cues in these situations.

## Prototype Tips[]

* Balloons can be used to lure Mobs to traps or to other hostile Mobs.
* Weapons that deal indirect damage, such as the [Fire Dart](/wiki/Fire_Dart "Fire Dart") or [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder"), are not affected by Wes's low damage multiplier, making them excellent choices for him.
* A [Belt of Hunger](/wiki/Belt_of_Hunger "Belt of Hunger") will nullify Wes's Hunger drain and also provide a boost to Sanity, although a [Backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") can't be equipped while wearing it.
  + In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, the [Hibearnation Vest](/wiki/Hibearnation_Vest "Hibearnation Vest") also provides a Hunger drain reduction, as well as the highest insulation against [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") and more than twice the Sanity regeneration of the Hunger Belt.
  + It's not efficient to eat food that restore more than 75 hunger (such as [Meaty Stew](/wiki/Meaty_Stew "Meaty Stew")), as the extra hunger points will be wasted.
* In *Don't Starve Together*, Wes's [favorite food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Fresh Fruit Crepes](/wiki/Fresh_Fruit_Crepes "Fresh Fruit Crepes"), meaning he gains 15 bonus Hunger when consuming it.
  + However, Fresh Fruit Crepes already restores 150 Hunger and Wes's maximum Hunger level is 75 Hunger. Because of this, unless they're spoiled, the player can't get any benefit from the bonus. While spoiled, Fresh Fruit Crepes will provide Wes with 65 Hunger, at the cost of losing 15 Sanity.
  + In addition, the dish can only be created using a [Portable Crock Pot](/wiki/Portable_Crock_Pot "Portable Crock Pot"), which means that it is impossible for Wes to obtain without a [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly") present.
