## Official Description[]

*Don’t Starve is an uncompromising wilderness survival game full of science and magic.*

*You play as Wilson, an intrepid Gentleman Scientist who has been trapped by a demon and transported to a [mysterious wilderness world.](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant") Wilson must learn to exploit his environment and its inhabitants if he ever hopes to escape and find his way back home.*

*Enter a strange and unexplored world full of strange creatures, dangers, and surprises. Gather resources to craft items and structures that match your survival style. Play your way as you unravel the mysteries of this strange land.*

*Key Features:*

* *Uncompromising Survival & World Exploration: No instructions. No help. No hand holding. Start with nothing and craft, hunt, research, farm and fight to survive.*
* *Dark and Whimsical Visuals: 2D characters and odd creatures inhabiting a unique 3D world.*
* *Randomly Generated New Worlds: Want a new map? No problem! At any time you can generate a new living and breathing world that hates you and wants you to die.*

## Overview[]

*Don't Starve* challenges the player to survive in a wilderness environment for as long as possible. In [Survival Mode](/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"), the only way the game ends is with the player's death or by restarting the game in a new random world through the use of the [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing"). When the player dies they are awarded [Experience](/wiki/Experience "Experience") for the number of days they survived. Each [death](/wiki/Death "Death") provides experience, which is added to a cumulative total and used to unlock additional playable [characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters"). Although death is permanent and the player's world will be lost when the game ends, various methods of resurrection can be found to stave-off the inevitable.

The whole process of gathering supplies, and making a go of surviving in the wild while fending off starvation, madness, and predators is quite entertaining."[[6]](#cite_note-6) *Hardcore Gamer Magazine* however was more negative, giving the game only a 2.5/5 rating and saying, "Unless there’s a major update in the near future, you’d be better off waiting until it inevitably becomes part of an indie bundle so that you can briefly jump in and enjoy its first few hours. Until then, your money and time should be spent elsewhere."[[7]](#cite_note-7)

*Don't Starve* was a finalist for the grand prize and "Excellence in Design" subcategory at the 2014 [Independent Games Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Games_Festival "wikipedia:Independent Games Festival") awards ceremony; it also received honorable mentions for "Excellence in Visual Art" and "Excellence in Audio."

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Upon starting a game in the PlayStation 4 version of *Don't Starve*, *Forbidden Knowledge* will play. However, a scene where Wilson cuts his hand is skipped to the part where he drips the blood into a beaker, which has been recolored to blue.[[10]](#cite_note-10)
* The game's art design was inspired by Tim Burton's work in films like *Frankenweenie* and *The Nightmare Before Christmas*, as well as Laika's *Paranorman*.[[11]](#cite_note-11) The work of Tom Waits was also a big inspiration for the look and feel of the game.[[12]](#cite_note-12)
