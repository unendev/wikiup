*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Surfboard](/wiki/Surfboard "Surfboard")*

Walani starts out with a Surfboard, which has ×1.3 the sailing speed of a [Raft](/wiki/Raft "Raft") but has only x0.66 the durability of one. The Surfboard can also be picked up and stored in the [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory") meaning players don't have to backtrack to where they left it in order to leave the island they're on. She can also craft it with 1 [Boards](/wiki/Boards "Boards") and 2 [Seashells](/wiki/Seashell "Seashell") from the [Nautical Tab](/wiki/Nautical_Tab "Nautical Tab").

Walani surfing with her Surfboard.

 

The Surfboard lets Walani ride on Big [Waves](/wiki/Waves "Waves") too, making her the only character able to do so naturally. Every time Walani surfs on a Wave with the Surfboard, she gains 1 Sanity and a ×5 (Small Waves) or ×7 (Big Waves) speed boost for a short time. She dries off from [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") 20% faster than normal, and so, her Wetness will drop faster than other Characters. Her Sanity also changes 10% slower from any sources that change it over time, but it does not count towards instantaneous changes towards her Sanity. She also does not have a sanity drain from [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") itself, although she does have a sanity drain from [Wet](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") [Items](/wiki/Items "Items").

### Disadvantage[]

Walani has lower maximum Health (an amount near that of [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes")) and her Hunger drains 20% faster than normal. Her lower maximum health means [Poison](/wiki/Poison "Poison") is more deadly to her, especially with no [Anti Venom](/wiki/Anti_Venom "Anti Venom") available. The limited durability of her Surfboard can be an issue, as a [Boat Repair Kit](/wiki/Boat_Repair_Kit "Boat Repair Kit") will be unable to be used at maximum efficiency, due to its maximum durability being lower than the amount repaired. Her Sanity will both drain and fill slower over time compared to other characters.

## Prototype Tips[]

* Since Walani starts automatically with her Surfboard, the player does not need to waste time gathering materials for a [Log Raft](/wiki/Log_Raft "Log Raft") or [Raft](/wiki/Raft "Raft"). Said time can be better spent exploring.
* While Boards require a [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") to be prototyped, players can acquire them without one, by using a [Hammer](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer") on [Crates](/wiki/Crate "Crate") found in [Beach Biomes](/wiki/Beach "Beach").
* Since the Surfboard does not require rowing, she can hold [Torches](/wiki/Torch "Torch") while surfing, making exploration in the early days easier.
* A [Captain Hat](/wiki/Captain_Hat "Captain Hat") may make the use of a single Surfboard more worthwhile, as it will delay gradual loss of normal boat durability. A [Pirate Hat](/wiki/Pirate_Hat "Pirate Hat") can be used to reveal more of the map while surfing.
* The Surfboard can only be hammered when deployed onto water, but it will not drop the materials used to craft it.
* A [Cargo Boat](/wiki/Cargo_Boat "Cargo Boat") with a [Cloth Sail](/wiki/Cloth_Sail "Cloth Sail") will have the same speed as the Surfboard, but an [Armoured Boat](/wiki/Armoured_Boat "Armoured Boat") will go faster, not accounting for the extra speed riding waves the Surfboard grants. This means that the Surfboard is at its most useful when riding large numbers of Waves is possible.
* Surfing on Waves in the [Ocean (Medium & Deep)](/wiki/Ocean#Ocean_(Medium_&_Deep) "Ocean") biomes is a cheap and easy way to restore a lot of Sanity quickly.
* [Purple Grouper](/wiki/Purple_Grouper "Purple Grouper") and [Tropical Bouillabaisse](/wiki/Tropical_Bouillabaisse "Tropical Bouillabaisse") can be used to give the Surfboard its speed boost and sanity gain from hitting waves no matter which direction the player is heading. This can be especially useful for fighting certain bosses at sea, such as the [Quacken](/wiki/Quacken "Quacken") or [Sealnado](/wiki/Sealnado "Sealnado").
* Because it is impossible to utilize [Boat Repair Kits](/wiki/Boat_Repair_Kit "Boat Repair Kit") at maximum efficiency on the Surfboard, it can be helpful to build a [Sea Yard](/wiki/Sea_Yard "Sea Yard") instead to keep the player's Surfboards repaired.
