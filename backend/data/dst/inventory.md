**“**I put stuff there!**”**

–[Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang")

The **Inventory** is a section of the [User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Interface "wikipedia:User Interface") where the player character's held [Items](/wiki/Item "Item") are displayed and accessed during gameplay.

The player can hold up to fifteen different stacks of items in the Inventory. Equipable Items can be placed in their respective equipment slot.

 ![Inventory Empty](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D) ![Inventory Empty](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/d/d3/Inventory_Empty.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/414?cb=20160803220001) 

An empty Inventory bar.

 

* The first fifteen slots holds all types of items, minus [Backpacks](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack").
* The "left hand" slot allows the character to equip a [Tool](/wiki/Tools_Tab "Tools Tab") or [Weapon](/wiki/Weapon "Weapon").
* The body slot is reserved for [Armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor"), [Clothing](/wiki/Clothing "Clothing") or Backpacks.
* The head slot is reserved for head Armor or hats.
* The hidden "right hand" slot is for items held directly with the player's cursor.

Using the three equip slots, one can equip Armor, Clothing, [Weapons](/wiki/Weapon "Weapon") and [Tools](/wiki/Tool "Tool"), applying them visually to the character. Most equipped clothing gives the character resistance to [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") or [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating"), and some restore [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") over time. Equipped Armor absorbs a percentage of damage taken from enemy attacks and certain environmental hazards. Equipped tools are used to harvest [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree"), mine [Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder"), catch [Fish](/wiki/Fish "Fish"), destroy [Structures](/wiki/Structures "Structures"), and other functions important to survival.

A full Inventory. The player has equipped a [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane"), a [Log Suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit"), and a [Battle Helm](/wiki/Battle_Helm "Battle Helm").

 

Most equipable items have limited durability, indicated by numeric percentages displayed over their Inventory icons. These items lose durability as they are used and most are destroyed when the percentage drops to zero. [Perishable](/wiki/Food#Perish_Times "Food") items are indicated by a colored meter in the backdrop of the slot they're held in. The meter decreases and changes color, from green, to yellow, to red as items spoil, losing their effectiveness.

Most items in the Inventory can *stack*, allowing the player to carry multiples of the same item in a single slot, leaving more space for other items. Items will stack up to 40, 20 or 10, depending on the type. Most equippable items do not stack, and some items, like [Tallbird Eggs](/wiki/Tallbird_Eggs "Tallbird Eggs"), do not stack due to their unique individual uses.

## Backpack Expansion[]

There are a few ways to expand how much space the player has to store items.

Wearing a [Backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") allows the player 8 more slots to store items, and wearing a [Piggyback](/wiki/Piggyback "Piggyback") gives the player access to 12 extra slots, but slows down movement speed. The [Krampus Sack](/wiki/Krampus_Sack "Krampus Sack") is a very rare drop from killing [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") and a rare drop from the [Loot Stash](/wiki/Loot_Stash "Loot Stash"), and gives the player 14 more slots, without a speed penalty. These three items can only be equipped in the body slot.

The [Quality of Life](/wiki/Quality_of_Life "Quality of Life") update imports the [Bundling Wrap](/wiki/Bundling_Wrap "Bundling Wrap") from Don't Starve Together icon to Don't Starve icon. With it, players can wrap up to 4 stacks of items into [Bundled Supplies](/wiki/Bundling_Wrap#Bundled_Supplies "Bundling Wrap"), which only takes up one Inventory slot.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/67/DS Containers All March.png/revision/latest?cb=20190322092543 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/67/DS Containers All March.png/revision/latest?cb=20190322092543 

All of the containers available to the player in [Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve"), including all DLCs.

 

Some [Structures](/wiki/Structures "Structures") can also be used to store items. They cannot be moved once they are placed, but they can be destroyed with a [Hammer](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer"). The simplest form of storage structure is a [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest"), each of which has 9 storage slots. [Ice Boxes](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box") also have 9 storage slots, but they can only hold perishable items (such as Food) and [Thermal Stones](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone").

Finding and picking up the [Eye Bone](/wiki/Eye_Bone "Eye Bone") will summon [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester"), a passive mob who will follow the player around. Chester's mouth can be opened to access 9 storage slots in his belly. The player can also transform Chester into [Shadow Chester](/wiki/Chester#Chester_Transformations "Chester"), gaining access to 3 extra storage slots within.

Alternatively, one may simply drop items onto the ground. Items from the Inventory can be dragged over the ground to place them there. However, it is safer to at least place items in Backpacks left on the ground to prevent Mobs from interacting with them, with the exception of [Splumonkeys](/wiki/Splumonkey "Splumonkey").

## Icon Tools Usage[]

Using the Inventory can be simple, and there are also some helpful [keyboard shortcuts](/wiki/Controls "Controls"). Clicking on an item or stack in the Inventory will bind it to the cursor. Then, hover the mouse over the ground and click, and the character will proceed to drop the item or stack on the ground. Also, it is possible to place the item or stack back in an Inventory slot by clicking the wanted slot in the Inventory. If the selected slot already has another item in it, the held item and the item in the Inventory will swap, binding the new item to the cursor.

When the character's Inventory is full, a newly picked up item will bind to the cursor and will be 'carried' around, similar to having an extra Inventory slot. This disables the character to pick up other stuff of the ground, though, suggesting quick Inventory organizing. Multiple smaller stacks of the same items can be combined in the same slot, until their stack maximum is reached, potentially saving some Inventory space. The game will use items, e.g. for [Crafting](/wiki/Crafting "Crafting"), from the first Inventory slot they are available, which may cause multiple item stacks if there is a smaller stack further right or in a Backpack. Combining stacks of food items will average their freshness, which may not be desired.

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Controls](/wiki/Controls "Controls")*

The first ten Inventory slots can be quickly selected by pressing the number keys. Selecting most items with the number keys triggers the character commenting on the item without forcing the examination with the opposite key. This does not apply for Foods and Tools, which causes the player to eat or equip the item, respectively. The 11th and 12th slots can also be selected by pressing the - and = keys respectively; and depending on the keyboard, they can be pressed on different keys.

Holding the Ctrl key and clicking on a stack of items will split the stack in half. Ctrl-clicking in an Inventory slot while holding the half stack will cause a single one of the items in the stack to be placed in the slot. This only applies if the selected slot is empty or contains the same item. Holding Alt and clicking on an item in the inventory will cause the character to make a remark on that item. To easily switch items between the Inventory and a chest, Shift key can be held while click on an item, and it will quickly move to a selected chest if that chest is not already full.

## Gift Icon Downloadable Content[]

In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC the player is able to craft [Scaled Chests](/wiki/Scaled_Chest "Scaled Chest"), which have 12 Inventory slots and are fireproof. The player can also craft the [Insulated Pack](/wiki/Insulated_Pack "Insulated Pack"), featuring 6 slots (8 in Don't Starve Together icon) of portable storage that slow the spoilage of food placed within.

Items affected by [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness"), a feature introduced in this DLC and present in all other expansions, are indicated with a blue border around their Inventory slot.

 ![Wet inventory](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D) ![Wet inventory](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/ac/Wet_inventory.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/414?cb=20140824205055)

In addition, the [Cargo Boat](/wiki/Cargo_Boat "Cargo Boat") provides the player with an additional 6 slots to store items inside of it. The player can craft a [Thatch Pack](/wiki/Thatch_Pack "Thatch Pack"), which gives access to 4 more slots. The [Sea Sack](/wiki/Sea_Sack "Sea Sack") works much like the Insulated Pack in *Reign of Giants*, giving 6 additional slots and slowing down food spoilage. The [Booty Bag](/wiki/Booty_Bag "Booty Bag") gives 8 more slots and drops 1 unit of [Dubloons](/wiki/Dubloons "Dubloons") daily. DLC Character [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly") starts with his exclusive [Chef Pouch](/wiki/Chef_Pouch "Chef Pouch"), which has 8 inventory slots and slows down food spoilage. As for structures, *Shipwrecked* adds the [Sea Chest](/wiki/Sea_Chest "Sea Chest"), a 9 slot container which can only be placed on the [Ocean](/wiki/Ocean "Ocean"). Chester is replaced by [Packim Baggims](/wiki/Packim_Baggims "Packim Baggims"), who will be summoned if the player acquires his [Fishbone](/wiki/Fishbone "Fishbone").

In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")* DLC the [Cork Barrel](/wiki/Cork_Barrel "Cork Barrel") has 4 storage slots. The [Root Trunk](/wiki/Root_Trunk "Root Trunk") has 12 storage slots and shares its equipment with other Root Trunks in the world. The [Vortex Cloak](/wiki/Vortex_Cloak "Vortex Cloak") is a dual Armor and Backpack and can store up to 8 items. Within a [Slanty Shanty](/wiki/Slanty_Shanty "Slanty Shanty"), players may construct [Shelves](/wiki/Shelves_Tab "Shelves Tab") that display up to 6 individual items. [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester") is replaced by [Ro Bin](/wiki/Ro_Bin "Ro Bin").

A character exclusive to *Hamlet*, [Wheeler](/wiki/Wheeler "Wheeler"), has only 12 Inventory slots, compared to the standard 15 slots of other characters.
