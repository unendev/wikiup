## PlaceholderTrivia[]

* His quote for a Tar Suit ("I hope there are no feathers around!") may be a reference to the act of [tarring and feathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarring_and_feathering "wikipedia:Tarring and feathering") a person.
* His quote for the Ring Thing ("One ring to teleport them all.") is a reference to *[The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings "wikipedia:The Lord of the Rings")* trilogy.
* His quote for a Cooked Rainbow Jellyfish ("You can really taste the "rainbow".") is a reference to the [Skittles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skittles_(confectionery) "wikipedia:Skittles (confectionery)") brand of candy.
* Warly's quote for the Thermal Measurer ("Splendid. I should like to know when the worm is going to turn.") references an old proverb "[Even a worm will turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_a_worm_will_turn "wikipedia:Even a worm will turn")".
* Warly's quotes for Beefalo and Water Beefalo ("Here's the beef.") may be references to the fast food chain Wendy's slogan "[Where's the beef?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_the_beef%3F "wikipedia:Where's the beef?")".
* His quote for the Harp Statue ("Headless harps-men.") is a play on words referring to the [Headless Horseman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_Horseman "wikipedia:Headless Horseman").
