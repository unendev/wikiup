|  | This page contains **major spoilers** for the plot of *Don't Starve* and *Don't Starve Together* as well as the story details of puzzles. Read at your own risk. |

The **Story Line** of *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* is not just contained within [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"). The developers have expanded the lore through supplemental material such as animated promotional videos or hidden puzzles. Some clues can also be gleaned from [character quotes](/wiki/Quotes "Quotes"). The Story Line continues in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, the sequel to *Don't Starve*.

On September 25, 2014, Klei developer Kevin Forbes[[1]](#cite_note-timeline-1) posted a rough canonical timeline for *Don't Starve*. This page will incorporate this. However, as it has been many years since this post, its accuracy can be questioned. For instance, this post was written before the reveal of *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")*.

  + April 17, 1906: The night before Maxwell and Charlie's last show, Charlie visits Maxwell's apartment. She finds his hidden room behind the fireplace. As she takes a look at his book, shadowy hands appear in the other room. They are vanquished by Maxwell who magically manifests from a photograph on the wall. Charlie uses her lantern to look at the walls of his secret room, where Maxwell has scribbled troubling words and strange symbols.

  + Unknown time point: Maxwell tries to capture his old creditor [George T. Witherstone](/wiki/Minor_Characters "Minor Characters") into the Constant, but hapless [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes") breaks in and gets kidnapped along with two [crows](/wiki/Crow "Crow") in his place.
  + Unknown time point before 1919: [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff") handed over a [spider](/wiki/Spider "Spider") from the Constant to [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber")'s father, a old friend, to help with some research. The spider later bonded with Webber and turned him into a monster.

Only a few radios remain, one being in the possession of [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson"). The founder of Voxola, Robert Wagstaff, was declared missing the same night as the fire.[[15]](#cite_note-15) He was actually sucked into a portal of his own creation[[16]](#cite_note-16) which also caused an explosion in his factory. Factory worker [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona") is unable to save Wagstaff and the portal breaks down. Winona repairs and reactivates the portal, just in time to see her missing sister Charlie. She tries to pull Charlie through, but Charlie's Night Monster side takes over and pulls Winona into the portal as well.[[11]](#cite_note-NoK-11)
  + 1921: [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson"), depressed after failing a scientific experiment, receives a message from his Voxola that he may be able to succeed with "secret knowledge", if he thinks he's ready for it. Wilson accepts the offer, and is given the knowledge to build a [strange contraption](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door"). He is ordered to pull the device's lever by the Voxola. Upon doing so, shadowy hands appear from below Wilson, pulling him into the Constant.[[1]](#cite_note-timeline-1) The Voxola was Maxwell all along.[[17]](#cite_note-17)

## The Constant Timeline[]

### Pre-Game Events[]

* The history of the [Ancient Civilization](/wiki/Ancient_Civilization "Ancient Civilization").
* Maxwell and Charlie arrive in the Constant.
  + Maxwell takes the [Nightmare Throne](/wiki/Nightmare_Throne "Nightmare Throne") becoming the "king" of the [Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant"), bending it to his will and creating many creatures which now inhabit it. Charlie becomes the [Night Monster](/wiki/Night_Monster "Night Monster").

#### Don't Starve and Reign of Giants[]

* Wilson spends an indeterminate amount of time in the Constant, dying multiple times.[[1]](#cite_note-timeline-1)
* The events of Adventure Mode begins, as Wilson finds Maxwell's Door and survives his challenges.[[1]](#cite_note-timeline-1)
* Wilson replaces Maxwell on the [Nightmare Throne](/wiki/Nightmare_Throne "Nightmare Throne"), and Maxwell becomes one of the survivors.[[1]](#cite_note-timeline-1)

#### Don't Starve Together[]

* Charlie banishes Wilson into a portal and takes the throne for herself.[[18]](#cite_note-18)
* Maxwell and Wilson meet, form a truce, and build the [Jury-Rigged Portal](/wiki/Jury-Rigged_Portal "Jury-Rigged Portal"), which joins the survivors' dimensions.[[19]](#cite_note-19) [Wendy](/wiki/Wendy "Wendy"), [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes"), and [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang") arrive through it just as Charlie takes the portal over and turns it into the [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern").[[20]](#cite_note-20) All the other survivors (excluding [Walani](/wiki/Walani "Walani"), [Wilbur](/wiki/Wilbur "Wilbur"), [Woodlegs](/wiki/Woodlegs "Woodlegs"), [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba"), [Wheeler](/wiki/Wheeler "Wheeler"), and [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff")) arrive through the Postern and join forces.
* Wilson, Wendy, [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom"), and [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") fight the [Ancient Fuelweaver](/wiki/Ancient_Fuelweaver "Ancient Fuelweaver").[[21]](#cite_note-21) Eventually, the Fuelweaver is taken away by Charlie. The Ancient Gateway destabilizes.[[22]](#cite_note-22)
* [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona") arrives in the Constant.
* Wickerbottom activates the Gateway with the Ancient Key. Wickerbottom, Wilson, [Willow](/wiki/Willow "Willow"), [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid"), Wendy, and Wolfgang enter it. Charlie appears at the activated Gateway and draws a white energy out of the structure, though the exact nature of her interference remains unknown. The survivors arrive in a dimension known as the [Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge").[[23]](#cite_note-23) The inhabitants were banished here by "The Throne".[[24]](#cite_note-24) Their leader, [Battlemaster Pugna](/wiki/Battlemaster_Pugna "Battlemaster Pugna"), calls the survivors "Gatekeepers" and accuses them of attempting to return his people to the Throne.[[25]](#cite_note-25) The survivors battle a series of increasingly difficult enemies in Battlemaster Pugna's arena before defeating the [Grand Forge Boarrior](/wiki/Grand_Forge_Boarrior "Grand Forge Boarrior"). Pugna surrenders and allows them to use the Molten Gateway.[[26]](#cite_note-26)
* Directly after the events in the Forge, Wilson, Wickerbottom, and Wendy find themselves in a new dimension: the [Gorge](/wiki/The_Gorge "The Gorge").[[27]](#cite_note-27) For years the goat-like inhabitants of this dimension have been under the threat of the [Gnaw](/wiki/The_Gnaw "The Gnaw"), a giant wyrm in the sky that turns those who fail to satiate its appetite into [Merms](/wiki/Merms "Merms"). Only a few beings remain alive, and the world has been left in ruins by the wyrm's rage. The survivors, with the help of [Mumsy](/wiki/Mumsy "Mumsy") the goat woman, must cook to satiate the Gnaw and eventually earn enough favors to charge the Ancient Key and grant them an escape. Mumsy, who also considers them Gatekeepers,[[28]](#cite_note-28) mentions that "another of [their] kind" passed through her dimension once.[[29]](#cite_note-29) The survivors succeed, making their exit through the Mossy Gateway along with Mumsy and her son [Billy](/wiki/Billy "Billy").
* A large piece of the Moon lands in the ocean. Wilson, Winona, and Wigfrid build a boat to reach the new island, on which they discover horrifying creatures and a bizarre aura of lunacy.[[30]](#cite_note-30)
* [Walter](/wiki/Walter "Walter") arrives in the Constant.
* Winona, Wilson, and Maxwell explore under the surface of the moon shard, discovering a cave network with [mysterious ruins](/wiki/Ancient_Archive "Ancient Archive"). They used [Iridescent Gem](/wiki/Iridescent_Gem "Iridescent Gem") to power the building. During their leave, they find [Greater Gestalts](/wiki/Gestalt "Gestalt") and Shadow Creatures fighting each other. Charlie show up briefly and disappears into the caves.
* Sometime between the time the moon shard falls and the time the survivor completes the three lunar altars: Charlie took the [Tragic Torch](/wiki/Cyclum_Puzzles "Cyclum Puzzles") to the Lunar Island. Charlie lifted the torch and sucked Gestalt into it, which then burst into white flames. She looked at the moon through the flames. Inside the moon was a [huge eye](/wiki/Them#Alter "Them").
* The Survivors complete the three [Lunar Altars](/wiki/Lunar_Altars "Lunar Altars"), releasing [Mysterious Energy](/wiki/Mysterious_Energy "Mysterious Energy"), and in turn caused a huge [storm](/wiki/Moonstorm "Moonstorm") in [The Forest](/wiki/Surface_World "Surface World"). At the same time, [Alter](/wiki/Them#Alter "Them"), who had been mistaken for a moon in The Constant, -- "[Them](/wiki/Them "Them")" or one of "Them" -- reveals itself. In the storm, the survivors meet [Wagstaff](/wiki/Grainy_Transmission "Grainy Transmission"), who asks them to help him collect static electricity and build a [device](/wiki/Lunar_Siphonator "Lunar Siphonator") on top of the mysterious energy. This device is used to harvest energy, but it happens to trigger some kind of defense mechanism, as the [Celestial Champion](/wiki/Celestial_Champion "Celestial Champion") comes down from the sky and destroys this device. Meanwhile, Charlie and two [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") arrive at the Ancient Archive.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The date and location of Maxwell's last act, April 17, 1906, coincides with the real life [1906 San Francisco Earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake "wikipedia:1906 San Francisco earthquake").
* The 1910 *[Exposition Universelle et Internationale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_International_1910 "wikipedia:Brussels International 1910")* was held in real life in Brussels, Belgium. Notably, it suffered a large fire that gutted several pavilions.
* The library fire in New York City that is seen on a newspaper headline in *Next of Kin* may be a reference to the real life fire that broke out in the library of the New York State Capitol on the same date, [March 29, 1911](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1911#March_29.2C_1911_.28Wednesday.29 "wikipedia:March 1911").

"The radio is a Voxola PR-76, manufactured in 1919 by the Voxola Radio company of Sidney, Ohio. The radio offered revolutionary sound and reception quality for the time, and was promoted by an intense national marketing campaign. Very few units were actually produced, because the factory was destroyed in a fire only days after production began. Voxola founder Robert Wagstaff went missing the night of the fire, and the company declared bankruptcy soon thereafter."
