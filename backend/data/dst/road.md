**“**He's too fast!**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

**Roads** are uncommon natural "structures" that can be found throughout the [world](/wiki/World "World"). Walking on Roads allows the player to move 30% faster. Roads often connect the [Pig Village](/wiki/Pig_Village "Pig Village") to the [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King"), though this is not guaranteed. It is not uncommon to find the [Eye Bone](/wiki/Eye_Bone "Eye Bone") located near a road.

Roads are different from [Cobblestones](/wiki/Cobblestones "Cobblestones") and cannot be dug up. Cobblestones are [Turf](/wiki/Turf "Turf") items, craftable by the player, that act like Roads when placed on barren land. These can be dug up and replaced using the [Pitchfork](/wiki/Pitchfork "Pitchfork"). A road's speed boost can be stacked with the [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane") and [Magiluminescence](/wiki/Magiluminescence "Magiluminescence").

## Trail[]

**Trails** (commonly referred to as **Path**) is a re-textured, transparent version of the Road. Likewise, it gives the same speed boost to players that are moving on it.

They are much more common than Roads, and usually don't lead anywhere in particular.

Trails are displayed differently than Roads on the map. Identical to Roads, they cannot be dug up as Turfs, though the ground directly beneath can still be dug up. They appear more frequently than Roads and may also lead the players to [Things](/wiki/Things "Things"), Pig Villages or [Ponds](/wiki/Pond "Pond").

Roads appear dark-gray on the map, while Trails appear light-brown.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* As of the *[Insanity!](/wiki/Version_History#Insanity! "Version History")* update, Roads look more natural and are a lot more curvy.
* During the [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), Roads and Trails are often covered by snow and can be very hard to see. The player can easily find where the road is by throwing items on it during the summer. Nearly-broken tools, weapons, and armor, [Wall](/wiki/Wall "Wall") pieces, and [Signs](/wiki/Sign "Sign") can be decent choices for marking Roads.
* The fact that there are natural paths in The Constant suggests that there were once many more survivors present.

## Mosquito Bugs[]

* Occasionally, Roads will go over patches of water, but they cannot be crossed.
* Sometimes, the middle of the road (but not the sides) may disappear, leaving whatever turf the road is on visible underneath.
* On the map, sometimes a road appears to have RGB spots along the edge.
