## Placeholder Trivia[]

* When inspecting [Evil Flowers](/wiki/Evil_Flowers "Evil Flowers"), WX-78 asks "HEY THERE, FLOWERS. WANNA... KILL ALL HUMANS?", a reference to [Bender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_(Futurama) "wikipedia:Bender (Futurama)"), a robotic character from the television series *[Futurama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama "wikipedia:Futurama")*, who has an obsession with killing all humans.
* When examining the Lying Robot, WX-78 says "HIS NAME IS HAL. HE IS MY FRIEND." This is a reference to the movie *[2001: A Space Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film) "wikipedia:2001: A Space Odyssey (film)")*.
* When examining the [Metal Potato Thing](/wiki/Metal_Potato_Thing "Metal Potato Thing"), WX-78 says "REMINDS ME OF MY MOTHER". This may be a reference to GLaDOS from *[Portal 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_2 "wikipedia:Portal 2")*, who takes the form of a potato briefly. This is also referenced in their examination quote for [Potatoes](/wiki/Potato "Potato") ("I FEEL KINSHIP WITH THIS STRANGE ROOT").
* When WX-78 examines the [Touch Stone](/wiki/Touch_Stone "Touch Stone") they say: "DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC" as a reference to the song "Do You Believe in Magic" created by The Lovin' Spoonful in 1965.
* Their battle cry "EXTERMINATE" is a reference to the Daleks from the television series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who "wikipedia:Doctor Who")*.
* WX-78, as with most other characters, is clearly puzzled at [Gold](/wiki/Gold "Gold") (which easily bends) having more durability than [Stone](/wiki/Stone "Stone") (which, as what could be worked out from its aesthetics, is a highly durable [metamorphic rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_rock "wikipedia:Metamorphic rock")), which is an inversion of the [durability scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness "wikipedia:Mohs scale of mineral hardness") in real life.
* WX-78's quote, "IT'S A TRAP", is a possible reference to Admiral Ackbar's famous quote in *[Return of the Jedi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi "wikipedia:Return of the Jedi")*.
* WX-78's quote for examining a Cave Banana Tree ("LIFE FINDS A WAY, UNFORTUNATELY") is a reference to the famous quote spoken by Dr. Ian Malcolm in the movie *[Jurassic Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park "wikipedia:Jurassic Park")*.
* Their inspection quote in DST for the [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff") ("THIS IS MY COLD STICK") is a reference to the line "This is my boomstick." from the film *[Army of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Darkness "wikipedia:Army of Darkness")*.
* WX-78's quote when examining a [Row Boat](/wiki/Row_Boat "Row Boat") ("I ROWBOAT") may be a reference to the movie *[I, Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot_(film) "wikipedia:I, Robot (film)")* and/or the collection of short stories of the [same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot "wikipedia:I, Robot") by Isaac Asimov.
* WX-78's quote when riding a [Wave](/wiki/Waves "Waves"), "01010111 01000101 01000101", is binary (a.k.a. base 2) representations of numbers 87, 69, 69. These numbers in turn correspond to ASCII character codes W, E, E. Therefore, their quote simply reads "WEE" in binary. Binary numeric system and the ASCII codes are used in computer systems.
* WX-78's quote for [Star-Sky](/wiki/Star-Sky "Star-Sky") while [Hutch](/wiki/Hutch "Hutch") is dead ("ONE FISH, TWO FISH. RED FISH, DEAD FISH.") is a reference to the book *[One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Fish,_Two_Fish,_Red_Fish,_Blue_Fish "wikipedia:One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish")* by [Dr. Seuss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Seuss "wikipedia:Dr. Seuss").
* WX-78's quote for the inactive [Ancient Gateway](/wiki/Ancient_Gateway "Ancient Gateway"), "ERROR 502", is a reference to the bad gateway server error in [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes "wikipedia:List of HTTP status codes").
* Their reaction to a repaired Moon Stone ("MOONBASE. AAAAA. MOONBASE!") may be a reference to "Moonbase Alpha provides a realistic simulation of life on a natural satellite", a video compilation of the text-to-speech chat in the video game *Moonbase Alpha*.
* WX-78's quote for the Knight trinket ("THE ONLY WINNING MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY") is a reference to the film *[WarGames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames "wikipedia:WarGames")*.
* Their quote for a Dark Sword ("HACK THE PLANET") is a reference to the film *[Hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film) "wikipedia:Hackers (film)")*.
* WX-78's quote for [Logs](/wiki/Logs "Logs") ("LOG(1) = 0") is a reference to a logarithmic rule. "Log" is short for logarithm, which is the inverse of an exponent. Log(1) = 0 is equivalent to saying that 100 = 1. Essentially, it means that any number to the power of zero equals one.[[1]](#cite_note-1)
* Their quote for a repaired Knight [Marble Sculpture](/wiki/Marble_Sculpture "Marble Sculpture") ("</HEAD>") is a reference to Hypertext Markup Language, or [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "wikipedia:HTML"). It is the closing tag for the <head> element, which defines the title of a webpage.
* Their quote for Marble Sculptures shaking on a full or new moon ("FREE HIM!!") may be a reference to a meme in which an image of a Pikachu figure (a character from the *Pokemon* franchise) encased in a plastic ball is accompanied by the text "free him".
* The quote for burnt [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree") ("I WIN. GOOD.") may be a reference to *Street Fighter II*, in which the announcer will say "You win! Perfect!" when the player wins a fight.
* WX-78's quote for the Pugalisk ("ERROR. MALWARE DETECTED") might be a reference to a "computer worm", a type of malware.
* WX-78's quote for their Midori Roboto skin ("WITH PARTS MADE IN JAPAN") is a reference to the song "[Mr. Roboto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Roboto "wikipedia:Mr. Roboto")" by the band Styx.
* One of their quotes for carrying a heavy object is binary. Translated, it reads: "n n n". This is possibly mimicking grunting from strain.
* Their quote for Freedom ("HELLO WORLD") is a reference to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) common program.
