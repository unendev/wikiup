Wilson's different stages of beard growth.

 

Being the default [Character](/wiki/Character "Character"), Wilson's [Health](/wiki/Health "Health"), [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"), and [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") all have default values and he has no drawbacks. Overall, Wilson is meant for better [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter") survival and efficiency, as well as easier access to [Meat Effigies](/wiki/Meat_Effigies "Meat Effigies").

Wilson's main perk is his magnificent Beard. Depending on its length, the Beard provides up to 135 insulation against [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") and can be shaved, providing [Beard Hair](/wiki/Beard_Hair "Beard Hair") and restoring 10 Sanity. If Wilson is resurrected by any means, the Beard will be reset.

Below is the days it takes Wilson to grow his Beard to the next stage, along with the number of Beard Hair gained and Insulation provided with each stage.

| Days of growth | Length | Beard Hair Yield | Insulation Rating |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 Days | Short Beard | 1 (0.25/day) | 15 seconds |
| 8 Days | Long Beard | 3 (0.43/day) | 45 seconds |
| 16 Days | Magnificent Beard | 9 (0.6/day) | 135 seconds |

## Prototype Tips[]

* The earliest one can build a Meat Effigy is on day 11. Shave as soon as possible for 1 hair, and shave the Long Beard for the other 3. This is not the most efficient way, but it is the quickest (outside of lowering Sanity to hunt [Beardlings](/wiki/Beardlings "Beardlings")).
* Wilson keeps his Beard when he uses a [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing") to move to a new world. This proves useful in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") when "King of Winter" or "The Game is Afoot" are still to be encountered.
* As the Beard doesn't grow longer after 16 days and the player loses it on resurrection or by changing characters, it is most efficient to shave after every sixteenth day, unless Winter is coming. In terms of gaining Sanity, shaving every 5 days will yield the best results.
* Wilson's Beard will take exactly 15 days to grow to its full length (full length at the beginning of day 16). Since Winter starts on day 21 on default settings, the player can easily survive the cold with just a full Beard and a [Thermal Stone](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone"). The Beard, unlike [clothing](/wiki/Clothes "Clothes"), does not have durability and will provide insulation so long as he does not shave.
  + Wilson can still shave the Beard after four days (for one Beard Hair) and still have a full Beard by winter. It is also possible to shave after reaching a **long** Beard length (8 days), as while Wilson will not *start* winter with a full Beard, the first few days are more mild and will allow for time to grow.
  + In *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* and *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")*, it is advised to shave at the beginning of Summer/Dry Season due to the Beard reducing the overall insulation against [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating").
