The Blossomed Wreath is an item added to The Forge in Don't Starve Together. Composed of the flowers of the flowering of life. Dropped in the middle of wave 10 from a random enemy unit with a 50% chance, a Magnificent Helm of Might can drop instead. If not dropped, it will fall guaranteed from the Great Crucible Hog Warrior.

It is put on the cell of the head. Restores 2 health per second (up to a maximum of 80% health), increases the cooldown of all abilities by 10%, increases the character's movement speed by 10%.

## Prototype Tips[]

* This wreath is a good way to maintain health without the help of a healer. It is recommended to wear this wreath to one of the team's tanks so that it can distract the Hog Warrior for longer if for some reason the healer is unable to cast lifebloom.
