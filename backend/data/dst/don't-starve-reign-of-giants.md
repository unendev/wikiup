Players can still play vanilla worlds by checking the checkbox labeled "DS", even in versions where *Reign of Giants* is bundled with the base game.

If the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* and/or *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* content is also downloaded, activation of this content is also done by checkbox in the 'New Game' menu, and only one of the checkboxes, *Reign of Giants*, *Shipwrecked* or *Hamlet*, may be checked for a new game.

* [Bone Shards](/wiki/Bone_Shards "Bone Shards"), [Electrical Doodads](/wiki/Electrical_Doodad "Electrical Doodad"), and [Pretty Parasols](/wiki/Pretty_Parasol "Pretty Parasol") were first introduced in this DLC. They were retroactively added to the base game during several respective *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* updates.
