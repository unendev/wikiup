**“**ITS A TRAP**”**

–[WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78")

**Set Pieces** are rare, naturally spawned structures and items in all game modes. They were introduced in the *[Doorway to Adventure](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve/Version_History "Don't Starve/Version History")* update. Players can usually find valuable [Items](/wiki/Items "Items") in the set piece. However, some set pieces function as a trap, forcing players to either bear the risk or disable the trap if possible. On some occasions, the player will have to retrieve the items from the set piece in order to escape the danger.

Players may also find [Skeletons](/wiki/Skeleton "Skeleton") lying around, oftentimes with items surrounding them. These are called **Failed Survivors**. Unlike other Set Pieces, they are never traps. A key way to tell the difference is that Failed Survivors lack structures, floors, walls, etc. Be aware that it is possible to find skeleton and set pieces combined. The spawn frequency of Failed Survivors can be adjusted in the [World Customization](/wiki/World_Customization "World Customization") screen.

:   ***Note:*** *The names of most set pieces are unofficial; they are nicknames invented by the Don't Starve community.*

## Contagious Rot Trap[]

* Expand slideshow
* Expand slideshow
* Expand slideshow

1/3

There are three variations of this set piece, all containing many pieces of [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot") which are lying around. One version of the set piece contains a [Backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack"), two [Ropes](/wiki/Rope "Rope"), two [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot"), [Straw Hat](/wiki/Straw_Hat "Straw Hat") and a [Straw Roll](/wiki/Straw_Roll "Straw Roll"). If the player opens a [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest") or a [Backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") from the set piece, all food in the player's inventory will spoil.
However, the player can avoid this by dropping all perishable items away from the trap and then opening the [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest") or picking up the [Backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack"), though this method may be problematic if there are [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") or any other kind of [Mob](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") nearby that might eat the dropped food. If the set piece contains a [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest"), there will be a large amount of [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot") and perhaps [Blueprints](/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint"). This set piece can be found in [Sandbox Mode](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode").

## Imprisoned Pig[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/20/Pig Cage Set Piece.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150405154953 



 

The [Pig](/wiki/Pig "Pig") Trap set piece can be found in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"), [Sandbox Mode](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode"), and *Don't Starve Together*. It consists of [Basalt](/wiki/Basalt "Basalt") on three sides, and [Obelisks](/wiki/Obelisk "Obelisk") on the other, with a [Pig House](/wiki/Pig_House "Pig House") in the middle. Players can use the Imprisoned Pig Set Piece in which Basalt spawns to trap any kind of mob, even giants in the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, and hold them prisoner there without fearing their escape. An easy way to trap them is craft a [Telelocator Focus](/wiki/Telelocator_Focus "Telelocator Focus") inside the "prison" and then use the [Telelocator Staff](/wiki/Telelocator_Staff "Telelocator Staff") on the desired mob.

## Disused Beefalo Pen Trap[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/39/Bones Trap 1.png/revision/latest?cb=20130403025818 



 

The disused [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") pen trap can be found in [Sandbox Mode](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode"), *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, and [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"). It's usually located in a [Savanna](/wiki/Savanna "Savanna") [Biome](/wiki/Biome "Biome") and consists of a long Wood Wall fencing that curls around a squarish piece of land. Inside the fence are several [Bones](/wiki/Bones "Bones") and [Beefalo Wool](/wiki/Beefalo_Wool "Beefalo Wool"), conveying the idea of an old Beefalo pen. There is a [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest") at the entrance, which contains 1 [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff"), 4 [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder"), and 4 [Logs](/wiki/Logs "Logs").

Everything inside the fence can be taken. However, the Chest is trapped and will catch on fire when it's opened. The fire will cause the Gunpowder to explode, light the entire wooden fencing, and destroy the contents of the Chest. A way to prevent burning is to [Hammer](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer") the nearby wood walls until they're destroyed. You can also extinguish the fire when the chest explodes. The fence can also manually be set on fire using [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch") - providing a large amount of [Ashes](/wiki/Ashes "Ashes"). This will not set the Chest on fire - but will also not disable its explosive trap. Hammering the Chest itself can trigger the trap.

All items can be taken from the Chest before the trap explodes, provided the player is fast enough. There is also a 34% chance for it to be a dud.

## Fire Staff Trap[]

* Expand slideshow
* Expand slideshow
* Expand slideshow

  Pigs fighting Red Hounds at the staff trap.

1/3

This set piece consists of a Fire Staff surrounded by sleeping [Red Hounds](/wiki/Red_Hound "Red Hound"). Once the staff is retrieved, all Red Hounds will awake, causing the player to lose a large amount of [sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"), and it will begin to [rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain").

The most efficient way to deal with this is to kill the Red Hounds before retrieving the staff, as each can be fought individually without fear of waking the others.

In *Don't Starve Together*, this set piece can also spawn in the Caves. This (and the one below) is the only way to have hounds legitimately in the Caves. This setpiece can be used with the [Bee Queen Crown](/wiki/Bee_Queen_Crown "Bee Queen Crown") and pushing the sleeping Hounds close together to passively regenerate close to 200 sanity/minute.

## Ice Staff Trap[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/ba/Ice Staff Trap.png/revision/latest?cb=20130327112131 



 

An [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff") trap, similar to the Fire Staff trap, is an Ice Staff surrounded by five sleeping [Blue Hounds](/wiki/Blue_Hound "Blue Hound"). Once the staff is retrieved, all five Blue Hounds will awake, causing the player to lose a large amount of [sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"), and it will begin to [rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain").

The most efficient way to deal with this is to kill the Blue Hounds before retrieving the staff, as they can be fought individually without fear of waking the others.

In *Don't Starve Together*, this setpiece can also spawn in the Caves. This (and the one above) is the only way to have hounds legitimately in the Caves. This setpiece can be used with the Bee Queen Crown and pushing the sleeping Hounds close together to passively regenerate close to 200 sanity/minute.

## Killer Bee Hayfield[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/46/Killer Bee Hive Set Piece.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140614022704 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/46/Killer Bee Hive Set Piece.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140614022704 



 

A [Killer Bee](/wiki/Killer_Bee "Killer Bee") Hayfield is a field of [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft") with 3 [Killer Bee Hives](/wiki/Killer_Bee_Hive "Killer Bee Hive") concealed within. It can be found in both [Sandbox](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode") and [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"). The grass makes it difficult to effectively target the Bees. To handle this, the player may plant a [Lureplant](/wiki/Lureplant "Lureplant") nearby, then destroy the Bee Hives and Lureplant once the area has been cleared of Killer Bees. Another way to get around this is to press F (attack) and that will instantly lock on to 1 bee/hive, but is not recommended unless you are tanking it. This Set Piece also has a version including a group of [Guardian Pigs](/wiki/Guardian_Pig "Guardian Pig").

Wendy may also clear this easily by having Abigail attack and destroy the Bees and Hives.￼

Note: The Killer Bee Hives are controlled by the sandbox settings. If one has them set to "none," this set piece will simply be a dense field of harmless grass.

## Living Forest[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/d/d9/Ym4yrAV.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131115151053 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/d/d9/Ym4yrAV.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131115151053 



 

A highly forested area with a large group of [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard") roaming around or sleeping, often more than five. The Treeguards are not aggressive to the player unless provoked. The Set Piece can be found in [Sandbox Mode](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode").

In *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")*, this set piece is common when nearing a [Desert Biome](/wiki/Desert "Desert"), but doesn't include any [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree").

There is also a *Shipwrecked* version of this set piece, featuring [Palm Treeguards](/wiki/Palm_Treeguard "Palm Treeguard") instead of Treeguards.

## Pigguard Berry Fields[]

  The smaller variant of the Guardian Pig Berry Field.

1/2

This Set Piece has a large patch of [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush") protected by a number of [Guardian Pigs](/wiki/Pig/Guardian "Pig/Guardian"). It appears in [Grasslands](/wiki/Grasslands "Grasslands"), [Savanna](/wiki/Savanna "Savanna"), and [Deciduous Forest](/wiki/Deciduous_Forest "Deciduous Forest") Biomes. It contains eight [Pig Torches](/wiki/Pig_Torch "Pig Torch") and 20 Berry Bushes. There is also a smaller variant containing only one Pig Torch and 22 Berry Bushes. The Berry Bushes may be replaced by [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft") or [Juicy Berry Bushes](/wiki/Juicy_Berry_Bush "Juicy Berry Bush") (*[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* only).

## Maxwell's Cemetery[]

  Another picture of Maxwell's cementery.

1/6

Maxwell's Cemetery contains [Graves](/wiki/Graves "Graves"), [Marble Pillars](/wiki/Marble_Pillars "Marble Pillars"), [Evil Flowers](/wiki/Evil_Flowers "Evil Flowers"), [Carpeted Flooring](/wiki/Carpeted_Flooring "Carpeted Flooring"), two [Maxwell Statues](/wiki/Maxwell_Statue "Maxwell Statue"), and a [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel"). The [Graves](/wiki/Graves "Graves") that populate the Cemetery are the same as those found within a [Graveyard](/wiki/Graveyard "Graveyard") (i.e. they drop the same items when destroyed, and can spawn [Ghosts](/wiki/Ghost "Ghost")). It can be found in [Sandbox Mode](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode") as well as in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode").

Each Grave has a different name on it when examined, which correspond with the names of the members of the development team at [Klei Entertainment](/wiki/Klei_Entertainment "Klei Entertainment").

Every grave dug within this set piece can spawn a Ghost. Digging the last grave will spawn a group of ghosts (one from each grave).

In *Don't Starve Together*, this setpiece can also spawn in the Caves. Digging up the graves is one of the few, and non-renewable ways of spawning Ghosts in the Caves. Ghosts do not spawn during a full moon as the DST caves do not feature a mooncycle.

## Miner's Camp[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b6/Miner Camp 1.png/revision/latest?cb=20130403030651 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b6/Miner Camp 1.png/revision/latest?cb=20130403030651 



 

This set piece consists of a Skeleton, [Miner Hat](/wiki/Miner_Hat "Miner Hat"), and [Opulent Pickaxe](/wiki/Opulent_Pickaxe "Opulent Pickaxe") beside a small base camp. Inside the base, there is a [Shadow Manipulator](/wiki/Shadow_Manipulator "Shadow Manipulator") and a [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent"). Other objects like [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush"), Bee Boxes, [Stone Walls](/wiki/Stone_Wall "Stone Wall"), [Wooden Flooring](/wiki/Wooden_Flooring "Wooden Flooring"), and [Crock Pots](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") may also be nearby.

If one manages to find these when starting in a world, this is a rather excellent place to take shelter, as it has a lot of things to keep a player alive, and can be "upgraded" to an even better base.

## Queens' Gathering[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/c0/Queen%27s Gathering.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150107013426 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/c0/Queen%27s Gathering.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150107013426 



 

A Queen's Gathering is a ring of Tier 3 [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Dens "Spider Dens") with an additional den In the center, commonly found in a forest. There is a good chance for a [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen") to appear. An easy way to prevent this from happening is to simply burn down the forest. The Set Piece can be found in [Adventure](/wiki/Adventure "Adventure") and [Sandbox Modes](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode").

This Set Piece appears in Don't Starve Together as well.

## Reed Trap[]

* Expand slideshow
* Expand slideshow

  The player being attacked.
* Expand slideshow

  [Rock Lobsters](/wiki/Rock_Lobster "Rock Lobster") brought to kill the Tentacles.

1/3

This Set Piece is a field of [Reeds](/wiki/Reeds "Reeds") that conceals a large number of [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle") around and inside it. It can be found in [Sandbox Mode](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode").

The player can attempt to collect the Reeds by wearing [armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor") and carrying a [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane"), but it is very risky.

Using a kiting technique, it is possible to slowly and steadily kill all of the Tentacles one by one. It is a good idea to set up a permanent camp nearby, as during the clearing process, the player will get a large supply of [Tentacle Spikes](/wiki/Tentacle_Spike "Tentacle Spike") and [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat").

Building several Pig Houses near the Reeds will result in a steady supply of [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") and [Pig Skin](/wiki/Pig_Skin "Pig Skin"), as well as gradually destroying the Tentacles. Although, any surviving [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") will likely eat any meat before the player can get to it.

Playing as or with a Wendy in DST can make clearing a reed trap much easier, as a level 3 Abigail can tank the hits of the tentacles while attacking. Since tentacles lock onto a target once they begin to attack, there's little to no risk of losing large amounts of health, and coming prepared with Spectral Cure-Alls can make the process extremely quick.

Alternatively, one can also use [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Dens "Spider Dens") to get large amounts of [Silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk") and [Spider Glands](/wiki/Spider_Glands "Spider Glands"). However, once the spiders take out the Tentacles, the player(s) will have to deal with a newly grown den, and potentially a [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen").

Once cleared of Tentacles, the area is a steady supply of usually hard-to-come-by Reeds, making items such as [Blow Darts](/wiki/Blow_Darts "Blow Darts") much easier to acquire.

## Spider Trap[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/9/93/Spider Trap 1.png/revision/latest?cb=20130403030203 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/9/93/Spider Trap 1.png/revision/latest?cb=20130403030203 



 

There is a [Spider Warrior](/wiki/Spider_Warrior "Spider Warrior") sleeping on a [Carpeted Flooring](/wiki/Carpeted_Flooring "Carpeted Flooring"), close to a little [Grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass") and [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs") farm. There are also Bones and a [Pig Head](/wiki/Pig_Head "Pig Head") around the Carpeted Flooring. If the Spider Warrior is attacked, three more Warriors will spawn around the player. Sometimes there are multiple sleeping Spider Warriors. In *Don't Starve Together*, some of the twigs are replaced by Twiggy trees.

One way to deal with the Spider Warrior without triggering the trap is to set down a [Trap](/wiki/Trap "Trap") near it, then stand next to the spider until it awakens. When it does, it's better not to attack it, but instead run past the trap and ensure that the Warrior will trigger it. Since spiders die when trapped, and trapping a creature does not count as attacking/killing it, the other three Warriors won't spawn. This method makes this trap a viable starter base if discovered in early game, as all characters can weave a trap without a [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") and the farm provides valuable resources, if in a small quantity.

The "Spider Trap" set piece is in both "Don't Starve Together" and it's single player counterpart "Don't Starve"

A Tallfort features a patch of [rocky terrain](/wiki/Rocky_Turf "Rocky Turf") with numerous [Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder"), [Stones](/wiki/Stone "Stone"), and [Tallbird Nests](/wiki/Tallbird_Nest "Tallbird Nest"). The [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird") there do not help one another out, and like solitary Tallbirds, go to sleep at night.

Using an [Old Bell](/wiki/Old_Bell "Old Bell") on a Tall Fort is an easy way to gather mass amounts of Rocks, Gold Nuggets, [Nitre](/wiki/Nitre "Nitre"), Meat, and [Tallbird Eggs](/wiki/Tallbird_Egg "Tallbird Egg").

It can also be found on the [BFB island](/wiki/BFB "BFB") in *Hamlet* worlds.

## Lightened Cave Camp[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a1/Setpiece-CaveFridge.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130701062645 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a1/Setpiece-CaveFridge.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130701062645 

Cave Camp with Single, Double and Triple Light Flowers.

 

This camp has a [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine"), an [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box"), a [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest"), a [Lantern](/wiki/Lantern "Lantern"), a [Fur Roll](/wiki/Fur_Roll "Fur Roll"), and a [Pickaxe](/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe"). The Ice Box may be empty, or it may contain a random amount of [Light Bulbs](/wiki/Light_Bulb "Light Bulb"), [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat"), [Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries"), and [Batilisk Wings](/wiki/Batilisk_Wing "Batilisk Wing"), if they haven't spoilt or rot by the time the player finds it. The Chest can contain a variety of items, including [Silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk"), [Flint](/wiki/Flint "Flint"), [Slurtle Slime](/wiki/Slurtle_Slime "Slurtle Slime"), [Healing Salves](/wiki/Healing_Salve "Healing Salve"), [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot"), [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log"), [Broken Shells](/wiki/Broken_Shell "Broken Shell"), and a [Fur Roll](/wiki/Fur_Roll "Fur Roll").

## Crop Circles[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/3a/Crop circles.png/revision/latest?cb=20211121202709 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/3a/Crop circles.png/revision/latest?cb=20211121202709 

The crop circles. There is nothing but turfs in this set piece.

 

This set piece consists of Grass Turf mixed with a pattern of spots of Savanna Turf. This set piece is likely a bug, as it's extremely rare and contains nothing besides turfs.

This set piece appears in both "Don't Starve Together" and "Don't Starve".

This set piece can be found in any [Biome](/wiki/Biome "Biome"), most often a [Forest](/wiki/Forest "Forest"), and consists of a [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest") spawned between a [Thermal Measurer](/wiki/Thermal_Measurer "Thermal Measurer") and an Ice Box.

The Chest itself contains an assortment of winter-related items, such as an Ice Staff, a [Winter Hat](/wiki/Winter_Hat "Winter Hat"), and a [Breezy Vest](/wiki/Breezy_Vest "Breezy Vest"). However, upon opening or Hammering the Chest (even if burnt), there is a 66% chance that [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter") will immediately begin, accompanied by the roar of Deerclops (though he will not spawn). Setting the Chest on fire in *Reign of Giants* drops its loot, without activating the trap. A [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") can also trigger the trap. It is safe to open or Hammer the Ice Box. Of note, *Reign of Giants* has [an identical set piece](#Summer_Icebox_Trap) found in the desert biome that activates summer instead of winter, and opening its Ice Box is NOT safe.

On trap activation, Wolfgang says 'Whoops.', Wendy will say 'Oh, goodness.', WX-78 will say 'IT'S A TRAP' Wigfrid will say 'Thats nöt a thing planned.', and the rest of the characters say 'Oops'. The trap can be found in both [Sandbox Mode](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode") and [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode").

If the player finds an icebox trap, it can be used to their advantage by triggering it during winter (if the trap is triggered on the first day of winter, the players won't have to worry about a longer Winter), thus providing the player with the winter items without the negative effects of immediate winter.

If the player activates the trap while the season preset for the world is "Summer only", the resulting winter will be permanent until restart.

If the player activates the trap while in Adventure Mode, winter will still begin and [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops") will spawn, but within 1 game day, seasons will revert to the preset for the current level. For example, if activated in *A Cold Reception* during summer, the player will have 1 day of winter, and then it'll return to summer the next morning. In an Adventure Mode chapter with no seasonal cycle such as *Two Worlds* the player may need to save, quit, and restart the game after one in-game day to revert the season.

In *Reign of Giants,* if the player starts in [Spring](/wiki/Seasons/Spring "Seasons/Spring"); since [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") is a lot more difficult to survive than Winter, especially without [ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice") to craft the best items to aid survival which melts easily during Spring, another good trick is to change the Summer to Winter with this set piece to delay the season for until the player has ice for a better chance at surviving the Summer by using ice based items.

MacTusk village in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode").

 

MacTusk Village is a group of [Walrus Camps](/wiki/Walrus_Camps "Walrus Camps") surrounded by a wall of [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree") on three sides.

This is a dangerous place in daytime during the [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), as numerous [MacTusks](/wiki/MacTusk "MacTusk"), [WeeTusks](/wiki/WeeTusk "WeeTusk"), and [Ice Hounds](/wiki/Ice_Hound "Ice Hound") spawn, aggressive to everything. Players are advised to avoid overnight stays at MacTusk Village.

### Pig Fortress[]

Pig Fortress in the forest.

 

The **Pig Fortress** is found only in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"). It is surrounded by [Wood Walls](/wiki/Wood_Wall "Wood Wall"), with several [Pig Torches](/wiki/Pig_Torch "Pig Torch") inside. It serves as a road barrier on the [Bridges](/wiki/Bridges "Bridges") between continents, as the [Guardian Pigs](/wiki/Guardian_Pig "Guardian Pig") inside are hostile.

**Passing through the fortress:**

* Wear a [Log Suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit") for minimizing damage from the Guardian Pigs.
* Bring some allied [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") to distract the Guardian Pigs while you are passing through.
* Wait until after a full moon, when many of the Pig Guardians turn into [werepigs](/wiki/Werepigs "Werepigs"). In the morning, the pigs will be asleep, making it easier to pass through. One can also use a [Pan Flute](/wiki/Pan_Flute "Pan Flute") to put the Guardian Pigs to sleep.

**Destroying the fortress:**

* Destroy the Wood Walls by setting the segments on fire with a [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch") or [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff").
* Bring some monsters like [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops") or a [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen") to fight the Guardian Pigs. Deerclops will probably destroy many of the structures in the process.
* Use a [Hammer](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer") to destroy the Pig Torches so that no Guardian Pigs will be spawned from them once they've died. You may want to leave some torches intact so you can utilize those pigs for resources later on.

  The Forest version of the Maxwell's Swamp Set Piece.

1/2

A Maxwell Statue surrounded by [Evil Flowers](/wiki/Evil_Flower "Evil Flower"), often at the end of a [road](/wiki/Road "Road"). The road is lined with [Rundown Houses](/wiki/Rundown_House "Rundown House") which spawn [Merms](/wiki/Merms "Merms"). The houses are situated on [Rocky](/wiki/Rocky_Turf "Rocky Turf") and [Cobblestone](/wiki/Cobblestones "Cobblestones") [Turfs](/wiki/Turfs "Turfs"). However, next to the Rundown Houses is a thin strip of [Marsh](/wiki/Marsh "Marsh"), containing many [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle").

The Merms may proceed to attack either the player or the Tentacles, but reaching the statue without aggravating the Merms is possible. This trap is found in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"), during the *Two Worlds*chapter.

A very similar trap, also in *Two Worlds*, is a [Maxwell Statue](/wiki/Maxwell_Statue "Maxwell Statue") surrounded by [Flowers](/wiki/Flowers "Flowers") and lined by [Pig Torches](/wiki/Pig_Torch "Pig Torch"). The layout is identical, but the Rundown Houses are replaced with Pig Torches, Evil Flowers are replaced by normal [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower"), Rocky Turf with [Grassland](/wiki/Grasslands "Grasslands"), Marsh with [Forest](/wiki/Forest "Forest"), and Tentacles are replaced by [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree").

This camp is set up on a [Grassy](/wiki/Grass_Turf "Grass Turf") area, next to a [Pond](/wiki/Pond "Pond") surrounded by [Trees](/wiki/Tree/Evergreen "Tree/Evergreen"). It offers a [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine"), a [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest"), an [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box"), a [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent"), and two [Improved Farms](/wiki/Improved_Farm "Improved Farm") with a [Pitchfork](/wiki/Pitchfork "Pitchfork") and a [Straw Hat](/wiki/Straw_Hat "Straw Hat"). Note that the Pond can spawn [Frogs](/wiki/Frog "Frog"), which incidentally may be the reason a [Skeleton](/wiki/Skeleton "Skeleton") lays nearby.

The Chest contains some items that can be found in caves ([Gold Nuggets](/wiki/Gold_Nuggets "Gold Nuggets"), [Slurtle Slime](/wiki/Slurtle_Slime "Slurtle Slime"), and possibly [Gems](/wiki/Gems "Gems")), while the Ice Box contains some spoiled food (rot if the player finds the set piece long after entering the [Cave](/wiki/Caves "Caves")). During the day, the set piece will be visible without a light source, as it is illuminated by the same spotlight that the Cave and Ruins exits have.

There is also another version that lacks the light, [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), and [Pond](/wiki/Pond "Pond"), but contains a [Drying Rack](/wiki/Drying_Rack "Drying Rack"), a [Fire Pit](/wiki/Fire_Pit "Fire Pit"), and [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot").

The ruins camp trap.

 

Found in the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins"), this set piece contains a Chest, a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot"), an Ice Box, a [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent"), a Science Machine, a [Prestihatitator](/wiki/Prestihatitator "Prestihatitator"), and a [Skeleton](/wiki/Skeleton "Skeleton"). The visitor should pay close attention once approached, as the camp has webbing covering the ground; [Dangling Depth Dwellers](/wiki/Dangling_Depth_Dweller "Dangling Depth Dweller") will descend, making it difficult for players to utilize this set piece safely (unless they are playing as [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber")).

There are set pieces based on a small patch of a [Chess](/wiki/Chess "Chess") biome. They are usually filled with [Evil Flowers](/wiki/Evil_Flower "Evil Flower"), [Marble Trees](/wiki/Marble_Tree "Marble Tree"), [Marble Pillars](/wiki/Marble_Pillar "Marble Pillar"), [Maxwell Statues](/wiki/Maxwell_Statue "Maxwell Statue"), [Harp Statues](/wiki/Harp_Statue "Harp Statue"), [Gears](/wiki/Gears "Gears"), [Clockwork Monsters](/wiki/Clockwork_Monsters "Clockwork Monsters"), and sometimes a [Spear](/wiki/Spear "Spear"). These Set Pieces make [Marble](/wiki/Marble "Marble") and Gears more abundant on the surface.

They can sometimes be found partly covered by the surrounding terrain, with only a few flowers, a statue or trees, or a few Clockwork Monsters present. Other times, the set piece is more elaborate. For example, the player may find one with a Maxwell Statue in the center surrounded by Marble Trees.

### Summer Icebox Trap[]

*Exclusive to:* Reign of Giants

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/4a/Summertrap.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160430131400 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/4a/Summertrap.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160430131400 

An activated Summer Icebox Trap found in the desert.

 

There is a Summer version of the Icebox Trap, however it will only spawn in the [Desert](/wiki/Desert "Desert") biome. When the chest is opened, the trap will trigger Summer at the maximum heat instead of Winter, and will contain items to survive Summer instead of Winter, such as the [Summer Frest](/wiki/Summer_Frest "Summer Frest"). Instead of hearing the roar of Deerclops, the player will hear the roar of the Dragonfly, which may or may not spawn in the biome. Unlike the winter variation, opening or Hammering the Ice Box will trigger the trap and start Summer as well.

The layout is very similar to the Tallfort set piece, having [Hounds](/wiki/Hound "Hound") instead of [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird").

It can also be found in the Swamp biome in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode").

### Homeless Pig/Merm[]

---

*Exclusive to:* Reign of GiantsDon't Starve Together

In any Biome, it's possible to find [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") or [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm") in groups of 2-4 that behave normally, but have no homes to which they can return when they would usually sleep. Sometimes both Pigs and Merms spawn in the same location and will begin fighting when the player enters the area. Wandering Merms can pose a threat to an unprepared player, and wandering Pigs can turn into wandering Werepigs during a Full Moon. However, a quick player can take advantage if they spawn together to grab their respective loot during the battle.

An example of an X Marks the Hat.

 

A [Pirate Hat](/wiki/Pirate_Hat "Pirate Hat") can be found in the middle of a large X on a sandy island. It is a safe Set Piece, and the Pirate Hat can be retrieved without worry of dangers, despite the Skeletons nearby.

The X is made of [Rocky Turf](/wiki/Rocky_Turf "Rocky Turf"), and it is the only place Rocky Turf can be found in a *Shipwrecked* world outside of the [Volcano](/wiki/Volcano "Volcano"), or without bringing more via [Seaworthy](/wiki/Seaworthy "Seaworthy").

This island is also known for being scattered with **boons**, some containing useful items, however, most not. It is known as many things, most common being **death island**.

Skull Island as seen in the map.

 

The Magma Skull is an arrangement of [Magma Turf](/wiki/Magma_Turf "Magma Turf") against a [Beach](/wiki/Beach "Beach") background. The eyes of the skull are made of gold flecked [Magma Piles](/wiki/Magma_Pile "Magma Pile"). Around the area many [Rocks](/wiki/Rock "Rock"), [Flints](/wiki/Flint "Flint"), and some [Gold Nuggets](/wiki/Gold_Nugget "Gold Nugget") can be found. If a player finds the correct [Message in a Bottle](/wiki/Message_in_a_Bottle "Message in a Bottle"), they can find and excavate a chest in the nose of the Skull, containing extremely valuable loot; namely an [Obsidian Armor](/wiki/Obsidian_Armor "Obsidian Armor"), an [Obsidian Spear](/wiki/Obsidian_Spear "Obsidian Spear"), 3 [Obsidian Coconades](/wiki/Obsidian_Coconade "Obsidian Coconade"), a [Boat Repair Kit](/wiki/Boat_Repair_Kit "Boat Repair Kit") and some other items.

This island is less of a set piece, and more of a required island, though it is supposed to appear in every S*hipwrecked* world there are cases where the island will not spawn due to a glitch. When it does appear it is usually found near the volcano, most likely a couple of islands away.

### Venom Gland Trap[]

Three [Venom Glands](/wiki/Venom_Gland "Venom Gland") found in the middle of 6 [Viney Bushes](/wiki/Viney_Bush "Viney Bush"). Picking up the Venom Glands will cause Poisonous [Snakes](/wiki/Snake "Snake") to spawn from each Viney Bush and attack.
