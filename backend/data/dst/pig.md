**Pigs** are neutral [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") that live in [Pig Houses](/wiki/Pig_House "Pig House"), which spawn in a variety of [Biomes](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes") and [Set Pieces](/wiki/Set_Piece "Set Piece"). While normally harmless, they will be hostile toward [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber"), [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox"), and [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt"). They also attack [Monster](/wiki/Monster "Monster") mobs (e.g. [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider"), [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle"), [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguards "Treeguards")) on sight. Pigs drop a [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") or a [Pig Skin](/wiki/Pig_Skin "Pig Skin") upon death. They will respawn from their houses in 4 [Days](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle") (32 minutes).

Pigs can be healed with any healing items. They are afraid of the dark and get hungry, but will not die by either, nor will they be damaged by [monstrous](/wiki/Monster_Foods "Monster Foods") or [spoiled](/wiki/Rot "Rot") [Food](/wiki/Food "Food"). They will try to eat any Food item lying on the ground within 10[m](/wiki/Metre "Metre"). If a Pig eats a [Vegetable](/wiki/Vegetable "Vegetable"), [Fruit](/wiki/Fruit "Fruit"), or [Petals](/wiki/Petals "Petals"), either off the ground or received from the player, it will produce a pile of [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure"), which it can do every 15 seconds; this makes them a good source of Manure. Pigs also see [Lureplant](/wiki/Lureplant "Lureplant")'s meat lures as food, and will pick and eat the lure if they can get close enough.

It is possible to attack a friendly Pig by Ctrl-clicking on it, which will cause it to become hostile and stop following the player. Feeding the Pig meat will stop it from attacking, and feeding another one will cause it to follow again.

Considered innocent creatures, killing one adds 3 points to the player's [Naughtiness](/wiki/Naughtiness "Naughtiness") level, which may spawn [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus").

## Behavior[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/3d/Sleeping Pigs.png/revision/latest?cb=20130729224056 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/3d/Sleeping Pigs.png/revision/latest?cb=20130729224056 

Pigs sleeping around a firepit; one is awake and looks frightened.

 

Pigs will return home at dusk and night, or frantically run around if homeless. Providing a light source, such as a [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch") or a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire"), will calm them and they will [sleep](/wiki/Sleeping "Sleeping") beside the light source throughout the night. In [Winter](/wiki/Seasons/Winter "Seasons/Winter"), Pigs will not sleep, but will instead stay awake around the fire with normal dusk dialogue, while displaying a scared animation.

Feeding a Pig [Meats](/wiki/Meats "Meats"), [Eggs](/wiki/Eggs "Eggs"), or [Inedible](/wiki/Inedibles "Inedibles") meat (e.g. [Slurper Pelt](/wiki/Slurper_Pelt "Slurper Pelt"), Pig Skin, [Bunny Puff](/wiki/Bunny_Puff "Bunny Puff")) will cause it to follow the player for up to 2.5 days. The length of time that a Pig will remain loyal is based on the hunger value of the given food. For example, feeding a fresh Morsel will cause the Pig to follow for 240 seconds (12.5 hunger value × 19.2 seconds). If a Pig eats 4 pieces of meat-based Monster Food (Monster Meat,Cooked Monster Meat,Monster Jerky,Monster Lasagna,Monster Tartare), or is outdoors during a [Full Moon](/wiki/Full_Moon "Full Moon"), it will turn into a [Werepig](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig").

## Hunting[]

Attacking a Pig will aggravate it and up to 5 Pigs within 30m. Aggressive Pigs [kite](/wiki/Glossary#K "Glossary"); they punch once then withdraw, before approaching the target to punch again.

Pigs can be damaged by Tooth Traps set by the player, but this will not make them hostile.

As Pigs are harder to deal with, will be aggravated by their fellow Pigs being attacked, and are not fully guaranteed to drop their loot when killed, it is quite inadvisable to hunt Pigs in their normal form; killing Pigs in their Werepig form is more predictable, won't aggravate normal Pigs, and guarantees richer drops, therefore is more advisable.

If one has plenty of red caps, they can poison the pig indirectly

Below is the number of hits it takes with each weapon to kill a Pig when playing with characters with a default damage modifier. The [Weather Pain](/wiki/Weather_Pain "Weather Pain") is not included due to the random nature of its projectile.

It takes 2 blasts to freeze a Pig with an [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff") and 2 [Sleep Darts](/wiki/Sleep_Dart "Sleep Dart") to put to sleep.

## Usage[]

Friendly Pigs have a [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") aura of +25/min; however, they naturally tend to keep their distance from others unless they are chopping [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree"), sleeping, or cornered.

When their loyalty time is less than 60 seconds, Pigs may animate as hungry, by which they pout and rub their bellies. If the time is more than 360 seconds, they may animate as happy. If loyalty time runs out or the player dies, they will return to their respective homes (or wander around if homeless).

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/62/Pigs chopping Forest.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130519233340 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/62/Pigs chopping Forest.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130519233340 

Pigs cutting down a whole forest.

 

Befriended Pigs can be commanded to fight; however, they will not attack [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures"). They can help chop trees. When the player hits any tree with an [Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe") once, they will join in chopping until the player and the Pigs are apart. If the Pigs spawn a Treeguard, it will attack them. Pigs do not work during dusk or night, nor in the dark.

They can wear [Headgear](/wiki/Category:Hats "Category:Hats") items; clicking on a Pig with a headgear selected will equip it on the Pig. They receive a head armor's damage reduction effects; however, durability will still be drained if the Pig takes damage. By wearing the [Miner Hat](/wiki/Miner_Hat "Miner Hat"), a Pig will provide light and not panic during dusk or in a [Cave](/wiki/Cave "Cave"), while also preventing nearby Pigs from panicking.

### Don't Starve Together Don't Starve Together[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, Pigs have a 1% chance to appear with a [Golden Belt](/wiki/Year_of_the_Pig_King#Golden_Belt "Year of the Pig King"). It is dropped if the Pig is killed, hit by a frog, or if a Pig reaches maximum loyalty. The Golden Belt is used to start the [Pig King Wrestling Match](/wiki/Year_of_the_Pig_King#Pig_King_Wrestling_Match "Year of the Pig King").

When haunted by a [Ghost Character](/wiki/Ghost_Characters "Ghost Characters"), Pigs have a 25% chance to become a Werepig.

## Tips[]

* The Sanity auras of friendly Pigs stack. Given their relative ease to befriend, and their tendency to sleep near a fire at night, befriending Pigs is a quick way to restore large amounts of Sanity. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/76/Pigs hungry.png/revision/latest?cb=20140515003605 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/76/Pigs hungry.png/revision/latest?cb=20140515003605 

  Hungry Pigs spotting food on the ground.
* Pigs will flock toward food left on the ground, even when surrounded by walls. When enough Pigs are bunched up in a group, they will be unable to kite effectively. When combined with the previous tip, Pigs will wipe each other out much more quickly.
  + The food in the walls can even be Rot. Though due to Rot stacks combining while off-screen, it can teleport out of walls.
* An easy way to farm Pigs is to go to a place with a lot of them (like a Pig Village), befriend one Pig, and order it to attack another. They will start attacking and killing each other off, leaving the player with a few seriously wounded Pigs and the loot; however, the survivors will quickly start eating the loot, unless the player intervenes. Occasionally, one befriended Pig may not be enough to start a full-scale war; players can attempt to create the war by befriending more before the first attack.
* Aggroed Pigs can be bribed with meat to stop attacking. This allows Webber, Wortox, and Wurt to befriend Pigs, if they also equip the One Man Band.

## Trivia[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a0/Pig wearing Football Helm.png/revision/latest?cb=20121209004730 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a0/Pig wearing Football Helm.png/revision/latest?cb=20121209004730 

A Pig wearing a Football Helmet.

 

* Pigs share the same hunchback model as [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman"), [MacTusk](/wiki/MacTusk_N%27_Son "MacTusk N' Son"), and [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm").
* Generally, the only way to get hats back from Pigs without killing them is to replace it with another hat, as fighting the Pig will break it before the Pig dies. [Frogs](/wiki/Frogs "Frogs") can also make them drop a given hat.
* They are referred to as "Pig Men" in the game files, but this label is never seen in-game, as the Pigs are referred to by their names. However, when [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang") examines a lit up Pig House at night, he says: "Hey! Come out here, Pig man!". Also, if the player is killed by a Pig, it will list the cause of death as "Pig Man" in the [Morgue](/wiki/Morgue "Morgue").
* Pigs used to pick up any food left lying on the ground at first sight. This made it difficult for players to take on enemies with their Pig friends and still get the meaty loot, so now there is a short delay before Pigs recognize and eat any recently dropped food items.
* Pigs have many Roman Names, especially those of emperors, such as 'Augustus', 'Constantine', 'Quintillus', 'Nero', 'Romulus', 'Hadrian', and 'Vespasian'.
* Pig names start with every letter of the alphabet except U.
* Pigs used to say things like "You not Pig" and "Ugly monkey man" when referring to [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson"); these lines have since been removed.
* Pigs used to panic if given any non-fire light source before *[All's Well That Maxwell](/wiki/Version_History#October_22.2C_2013_-_All.27s_Well_that_Maxwell "Version History")*, but they will still refer to any light source as a fire.
* If a Pig is being chased by any type of hostile Pig, it will run from it. It will keep running from the Pig until it is hit or the hostile Pig gives up.
* Pigs can eat stale or spoiled food, poisonous food, and even Rot off the ground. They will not suffer any ill effects from any of these items.
* The name "Cheeky Chris" was added as a reference to the Klei Forum user "[GuyNamedChris](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/profile/563359-chris1448/)", when he showed the forum a chat log between him and a dev that gave hints to the [Cyclum Puzzles](/wiki/Cyclum_Puzzles "Cyclum Puzzles") while it was still happening in April 2016. Later that day, the games were updated and "Cheeky Chris" was added to the name table.
* Unlike [Pig Traders](/wiki/Pig_Traders "Pig Traders"), vanilla Pigs all appear to be male and have exclusively masculine names.
* If there is a light source in the cave, they will come out of their Pig Houses.

## Bugs[]

* At night, Pigs in their houses will sometimes talk as if they weren't inside. For instance, they will talk about how much they dislike darkness, and when hostile mobs wander near, they'll make their usual fight chatter. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/10/Pig Bug.png/revision/latest?cb=20130618191548 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/10/Pig Bug.png/revision/latest?cb=20130618191548 

  Bugged Pigs walking on the ocean.
* If one builds a Pig House near the ocean, occasionally, they will (re)spawn and walk on the ocean.
* Pigs have also been known to "moonwalk".
* Due to the way the "Give" command works, it's possible to give Pigs items such as [Thulecite](/wiki/Thulecite "Thulecite") or [Gems](/wiki/Gems "Gems"), which cannot be retrieved without killing the Pig; they will however, still turn down [Teleportato pieces](/wiki/Things "Things") or Gravedigger items.
* In previous updates, if a Pig's house was behind an obstacle (say, a land border), at dusk the Pig would run continuously into the obstacle or border through dusk and night time until day returned. This still happens, but very rarely.
* If a Pig is transformed into a Werepig and then becomes a normal Pig, it may have similar health to a Werepig's. Meaning that it will have 350 max Health instead of 250 Health.
* If one feeds a Pig four pieces of Monster Meat, and then Saves and Quits the game before the fourth eating animation plays, when the game is reloaded the Pig will not have transformed into a Werepig, despite having eaten all four Monster Meat and gaining the befriended time for all four pieces. The Pig will also refuse any additional Monster Meat offered.
* It is possible to befriend a Pig and not consume any resources. This can be accomplished by giving a Pig fighting a frog a piece of meat. The "befriending" music will play when the meat is given, but it will not immediately consume the food because it is in combat. When the Frog attacks the Pig, the meat will be knocked out of their "inventory" and the player can then retrieve it. Once the Frog has been killed, the Pig will remain friendly to the player despite not being fed.
