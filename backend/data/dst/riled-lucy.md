–[Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona"), when examining Riled Lucy in the Forge

**Riled Lucy** is [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie")'s starting [Item](/wiki/Item "Item") in [The Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge") .

Used as a melee weapon it deals 20 physical damage to an enemy. Woodie with Wild Lucy equipped attacks one and a half times faster.

Unlike her normal counterpart, the wild Lucy can be picked up by other [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") who specialize in melee combat.

Wild Lucy's main ability is Lucy Chuck: Throw Lucy in a given direction, dealing 30 physical damage, provoking the target to throw and breaking the target's armor (a broken shield icon appears above the enemy, and it will be dealt 5-10% more damage). Lucy stays where she fell if she was thrown by any character other than Woodie; if thrown by Woodie, it returns to his hand.

## Tips[]

* Only Woodie gets bonuses using Lucy, so it's not recommended to fight Lucy with other characters.
* The increased hitting speed is quite useful in the early game. With it, Woodie can more effectively "tank" enemies than other characters (it is recommended to have well-protective armor).
* Lucy's throw is the perfect distraction for dangerous creatures from the team. With the speed boost gear, you can constantly throw Lucy at the Svinorill without fear of getting hit while the rest of the team clears the arena of other enemies.
