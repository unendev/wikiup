Frog Rain may happens during [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain"), spawning 1 [Frog](/wiki/Frog "Frog") every 0.1-2 seconds, within 60[m](/wiki/Distance "Distance") of the player. This is an opportunity to obtain 40-100 [Frogs Legs](/wiki/Frog_Legs "Frog Legs").

## Occurrence[]

They may happen In the ["A Cold Reception"](/wiki/Adventure_Mode#A_Cold_Reception "Adventure Mode") and ["The Game Is Afoot"](/wiki/Adventure_Mode#The_Game_Is_Afoot "Adventure Mode") chapters in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode").

This also has 16% chance to happen during [Spring](/wiki/Seasons/Spring "Seasons/Spring") rain. The occurrence is decided at the start of the rain. The Frogs only start raining when the rain is heavier. The Frogs rain while the [precipitation](/wiki/Rain#Moisture "Rain") is above 5.5 and the [Moisture Ceiling](/wiki/Rain#Moisture "Rain") is above 2500.

## Strategy[]

Attacking the frogs individually is generally not advisable as the Frogs spawn too fast to be killed, resulting in them stacking up, stunlocking and looting the player.

### Luring to other mobs[]

The Frogs can be lured to various mobs, among which are [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") and [Moose](/wiki/Moose/Goose "Moose/Goose"). There are also options like [Pig](/wiki/Pig "Pig"), [Bunnyman](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman"), The luring strategy is especially good in that it also generate loot from the other mobs the Frogs may kill.

The Frogs can be lured to a [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") herd. Move to a [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") herd as soon as a frog rain starts. Beefalos are in heat during [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring") and will attack the Frogs. If the Beefalo herd is small, a large number of Frogs may end up winning the fight. While the Beefalos are in heat, a [Beefalo Hat](/wiki/Beefalo_Hat "Beefalo Hat") should be worn when picking up the Frog Legs to prevent Beefalos from attacking. Be careful about having tamed Beefalo or Beefalo being tamed, especially if they are alone, as they can be killed by Frogs.

The Frogs can be lured to a [Moose](/wiki/Moose/Goose "Moose/Goose"). Run to a Moose or [Mosling](/wiki/Mosling "Mosling") as soon as a frog rain starts. Frogs are hostile to Moose and Mosling and hence frogs themselves can start the fight. Frogs from a single player have a good chance of killing the Moose and Moslings. Moslings may be restarting rain when they attack, and if the Frog rain did not end when the rain is restarted, Frog rain will reoccur when the rain is heavy, when the precipitation is more rate 5.5.

### Using area damage or effect[]

Characters such as [Wendy](/wiki/Wendy "Wendy") and [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Woodie/Don't Starve Together")Don't Starve Together have frequent area damage to kill mass Frogs.

[Abigail](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail") can also deal with a large number of Frogs, but it doesn't take long until she's overwhelmed. However, in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, she is much more durable, and can be given a [Spectral Cure-All](/wiki/Ghostly_Elixir#Spectral_Cure-All "Ghostly Elixir") to heal at a much faster rate than the Frogs can damage her. [Wendy](/wiki/Wendy "Wendy") can also use other [Ghostly Elixir](/wiki/Ghostly_Elixir "Ghostly Elixir") such as [Unyielding Draught](/wiki/Ghostly_Elixir#Unyielding_Draught "Ghostly Elixir") or [Revenant Restorative](/wiki/Ghostly_Elixir#Revenant_Restorative "Ghostly Elixir").

Woodie's [Weremoose](/wiki/Woodie/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Woodie/Don't Starve Together") can be charged repeatedly to avoid being hit by the frogs while damaging them.

The player can use [Ice Flingomatic](/wiki/Ice_Flingomatic "Ice Flingomatic") to freeze the Frogs, and then kill the Frogs individually. Ice Flingomatic can be triggered to fire on an area by placing burnables, like [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs") under a [Dwarf Star](/wiki/Star_Caller%27s_Staff "Star Caller's Staff") within Ice Flingomatic range.

### Using castle[]

[Traps](/wiki/Trap "Trap") can be used to deal with the Frogs and to obtain [Frog Legs](/wiki/Frog_Legs "Frog Legs"). At least 10 Traps would be needed.

### Running away[]

Hide in the caves or be constantly on the move. Frogs from Frog Rain will despawn once unloadedDon't Starve Together.

## Don't Starve Together Don't Starve Together[]

Frogs from Frog Rain will despawn once unloaded. If [Lunar Rifts](/wiki/Wild_Rift_Cycle#Lunar_Rifts "Wild Rift Cycle") have been activated, [Bright-Eyed Frogs](/wiki/Bright-Eyed_Frog "Bright-Eyed Frog"). replace 60% of the Frogs
