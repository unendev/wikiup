In [Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve"), Webber can safely eat [Monster Foods](/wiki/Monster_Food "Monster Food") without any adverse health effects, grow a silky smooth beard, and befriend [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider"). Webber can also safely eat raw [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") without penalties.

Webber starts the game with 2 [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") and [Spider Eggs](/wiki/Spider_Eggs "Spider Eggs"), which can be used to plant a [Spider Den](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den"). If the [Hamlet DLC](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet") is enabled, then Webber will start with the [Shamlet Mask](/wiki/Shamlet_Mask "Shamlet Mask").

## Spider Spiders[]

Spiders (including [Spider Queens](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen"), all forms of [Cave](/wiki/Caves "Caves") spiders, as well as the venomous variant of [Spider Warriors](/wiki/Spider_Warrior "Spider Warrior") found in Shipwrecked) are neutral towards Webber, regarding him as one of their own. Webber does not lose [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") from being close to spiders and does not alarm them when walking on the sticky webbing around a Spider Den, nor does his walking speed decrease. Webber can upgrade Spider Dens with 5 Silk as well as craft new Spider Dens within the [Structures Tab](/wiki/Structures_Tab "Structures Tab") for 12 Silk, 6 [Spider Glands](/wiki/Spider_Gland "Spider Gland"), and 6 [Papyrus](/wiki/Papyrus "Papyrus").

Webber can befriend Spiders by giving them Meat. A Spider fed this way and up to 2 other spiders within 15 units (3.75 [Pitchfork](/wiki/Pitchfork "Pitchfork") tiles) will follow Webber and protect him for up to 2.5 Days (20 minutes). Spiders will follow for 19.2 seconds per [Calorie](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") in the Meat (4 minutes or half a day for a [Morsel](/wiki/Morsel "Morsel")). Befriending spiders that were spawned by Spider Queens does not grant any additional Spiders aside from the one that was fed.

## Silky Farmspider Beard Icon Silky Beard[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a4/Webber Beard Growth.png/revision/latest?cb=20140506083517 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a4/Webber Beard Growth.png/revision/latest?cb=20140506083517 

Webber's different stages of beard growth.

 

Webber grows a beard made of Silk much like [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") grows one made of [hair](/wiki/Beard_Hair "Beard Hair"). It takes 3 days per stage of beard growth, a total of 9 days for full length (compared to 16 days for Wilson). Webber's silky beard provides 3/4 as much insulation from [freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") as Wilson's beard would. When Webber is revived by a [Touch Stone](/wiki/Touch_Stone "Touch Stone") or [Meat Effigy](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy"), his beard will disappear.

When shaving with a [Razor](/wiki/Razor "Razor"), Webber gains 10 Sanity and drops Silk to the ground. Shaving every 3 days is half as efficient as waiting for the full beard to grow out (0.33 Silk/day vs. 0.67 Silk/day). Below is the days it takes Webber to grow his beard to the next stage, along with the number of Silk gained and insulation provided with each stage.

| Days until growth | Length | Silk yield | Insulation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 days | Short beard | Silkx1 | 11.25 |
| 6 days | Long beard | Silk×3 | 33.75 |
| 9 days | Silky Smooth beard | Silk×6 | 67.5 |

## Disadvantages[]

* "Good" mobs that are hostile to Spiders will also be hostile to Webber. This means that [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig"), [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnymen "Bunnymen"), [Catcoons](/wiki/Catcoon "Catcoon"), as well as [Bottlenose Ballphins](/wiki/Bottlenose_Ballphin "Bottlenose Ballphin") and [Wildbores](/wiki/Wildbore "Wildbore") in Shipwrecked, will attack Webber on sight and cannot be befriended.
* Webber has a lower Sanity maximum, meaning he will experience changes in sanity far faster than other characters and is more susceptible to [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature").
* The world of [Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet") is significantly more dangerous to Webber, as all [Royal Guards](/wiki/Royal_Guard "Royal Guard") as well as [Pogs](/wiki/Pog "Pog") will attack him on sight, unless he is wearing the Shamlet Mask.
* [Spider Monkeys](/wiki/Spider_Monkey "Spider Monkey") are incapable of being befriended by Webber and pose the same threat to him as any other character.

## Prototype Tips[]

### General[]

* Webber's low sanity can easily be managed by crafting a [Top Hat](/wiki/Top_Hat "Top Hat") out of the Silk he collects from farming Spiders or shaving his Beard.
* As the beard doesn't grow longer after 9 days and the player loses it on resurrection, it is most efficient to shave after every 9th night.
  + As the Beard will take exactly 9 days to grow to its full length (full length at the beginning of day 10), the player can shave once to get the Silk and still have a full beard in time for Winter on day 21 (default settings). The player can easily survive the cold with just a full Beard and a [Thermal Stone](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone").
  + It is advised to shave at the beginning of Summer due to the beard accelerating the rate at which Webber overheats.
* Webber keeps his beard when using a [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing") to move to a new world. This proves useful in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") when "The King of Winter" or "The Game is Afoot" are still to be encountered.
* Due to his perks, Webber makes an excellent character for [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") and [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") exploration as there are far more Spiders underground than there are Bunnymen.
* Since Webber does not spawn Spiders when walking on webbing, it is advised to use [Glommer](/wiki/Glommer "Glommer") to make the Spiders come out, as Glommer can trigger their spawn even while flying and will not be attacked.
* While Webber can safely eat raw Meat, it is still advised to cook any stockpiled Meat in order to greatly increase its spoilage time. Both normal Meat and Monster Meat will rot after 6 days, while cooked Meat will rot after 10 and Monster Meat after 15.

### Spiders[]

* Befriended Spiders will eat any Meat, [Pig Skins](/wiki/Pig_Skin "Pig Skin") and [Bunny Puffs](/wiki/Bunny_Puff "Bunny Puff") dropped from their kill after a short time, so the player needs to act quickly if they want to collect these drops.
* Spiders will occasionally attack [Walls](/wiki/Wall "Wall"), so it is recommended to place any Walls away from the Spider Dens.
* Spiders will attack [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester") on sight. This can be used to player's advantage with smaller dens, using him as bait. However, with larger dens, it is recommended to either leave Chester away from Spiders.
* Feeding Meat or Pig Skin to a Spider will cause multiple spiders to follow Webber within a small radius. With only a few pieces of easily acquired meat (i.e. [Frog Legs](/wiki/Frog_Legs "Frog Legs"), [Morsels](/wiki/Morsel "Morsel")), Webber can amass a very large following by only feeding a few spiders.
* Since Webber can use Meat to recruit new Spiders, he can quickly amass an army by having the Spiders attack any creatures that drop Meat and using the drops to recruit more. Spiders that fall in battle may also leave behind Monster Meat, which is also usable to recruit.
* It is advised to befriend [Cave Spiders](/wiki/Cave_Spider "Cave Spider") and [Spitters](/wiki/Spitter "Spitter") for one's personal army. While Webber and the Cave Spiders can tank the enemy, Spitters can decimate them from afar, away from danger.
* Befriended Spider Warriors can be used to easily hunt small animals ([Butterflies](/wiki/Butterflies "Butterflies"), [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbits "Rabbits"), etc.) as their jump attack has enough range to kill small prey before they can run.
* To order a Spider to attack another Spider, press the hotkey for attacking an enemy (For example, "F" on keyboard) before immediately moving the character to cancel the attack. If it is done too fast, nothing will happen. If done too slow, the player will end up attacking the spider, and some spiders will try to retaliate. If timed just right, Webber will say his battle line despite the attack not landing, thus inciting the allied Spider(s) without drawing any risk to Webber.
* To safely and easily collect large amounts of Monster Meat, Silk, and Spider Glands, players can use the following technique:
  1. Plant multiple Spider Dens in a small area.
  2. When Spiders are wandering around during the dusk/night, feed one a piece of Meat and order it to attack another Spider.
  3. This will cause all of the Spiders nearby to swarm the offending follower.
  4. This will cause a war between the Spiders, causing all nearby Spiders to attack each other.
