*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 See also: [Battle Spear](/wiki/Battle_Spear "Battle Spear") and [Battle Helm](/wiki/Battle_Helm "Battle Helm")*

Wigfrid starts the game with the Battle Spear and Battle Helm, two craftable items that are exclusive to her. The Helm protects for 80% of incoming damage and has nearly double the durability of a [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet"), while the Battle Spear deals 42.5 damage and has 200 uses. Both these items prove incredibly useful in the early days of the game, due to their cheap cost and high stats.

Wigfrid does 25% more damage (melee and ranged combat) and takes 25% less incoming damage.

When she kills an enemy, she gains Health and [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"), allowing her to continue fighting enemy after enemy, `Health & sanity gain = Mob's damage × 0.25`. For example, if she kills a [Spider](/wiki/Spider "Spider"), she gains 5 Health and Sanity (20 × 0.25 = 5)

## Disadvantages[]

Wigfrid has a Meat-only diet, limiting her choice of food greatly and requiring her to always be hunting for food in the early days instead of a more relaxed approach. Her maximum Hunger and Sanity are also comparatively low, each at a value of 120.

## Prototype Tips[]

* Wigfrid can eat all Meat type foods, even those that are not entirely meat, such as meatballs. [Eggs](/wiki/Eggs "Eggs") are an animal product and thus count as meat.
* Wigfrid's diet can be detrimental in a few ways:
  1. She is unable to fully take advantage of beneficial food, such as [Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries"), [Carrots](/wiki/Carrots "Carrots") and [Butterfly Wings](/wiki/Butterfly_Wings "Butterfly Wings") during early exploration, [Green Mushrooms](/wiki/Green_Mushroom "Green Mushroom") and [Cooked Cacti Flesh](/wiki/Cooked_Cactus_Flesh "Cooked Cactus Flesh") for Sanity management.
     + Once a Crock Pot is crafted she can use these foods as filler.
  2. Her options using a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") become limited, as she misses out on some useful recipes like [Dragonpie](/wiki/Dragonpie "Dragonpie"), [Butter Muffin](/wiki/Butter_Muffin "Butter Muffin") and [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy"). Taffy is edible in [DST](/wiki/DST "DST").
  3. In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC, she is unable to drink [Coffee](/wiki/Coffee "Coffee") and thus misses out on the massive speed bonus.
* Carrying Meat while exploring [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") can be dangerous, because it will automatically trigger [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") to attack, though this can be avoided by storing Meat items in [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester"), or its *Don't Starve Together* counterpart, [Hutch](/wiki/Hutch "Hutch").
* As a temporary measure, eating [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") can be used as a means of survival, especially since she can regain lost Health and Sanity from killing mobs.
* [Farms](/wiki/Farm "Farm") and some other structures can still be beneficial to Wigfrid. Crops from Farms can make good filler and are sometimes essential in some Meat-based recipes. [Carrots](/wiki/Carrots "Carrots") can be used to befriend [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnymen "Bunnymen"). [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bushes "Berry Bushes") can be used to hunt [Gobblers](/wiki/Gobbler "Gobbler"). [Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries") can be used as filler or turned into [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure")/[Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot") for easy fire fuel. A [Bird Cage](/wiki/Bird_Cage "Bird Cage") can be used to turn rotting meat into [Eggs](/wiki/Egg "Egg"). Honey from [Bee Boxes](/wiki/Bee_Box "Bee Box") can be used to make [Honey Ham](/wiki/Honey_Ham "Honey Ham") and [Honey Nuggets](/wiki/Honey_Nuggets "Honey Nuggets") or [Honey Poultice](/wiki/Honey_Poultice "Honey Poultice"). [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") can be used to bait Bird Traps.
* A base/camp near a [Sinkhole](/wiki/Sinkhole "Sinkhole") allows Wigfrid to kill the [Batilisks](/wiki/Batilisk "Batilisk") that spawn at [Dusk](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle") for some easy Health and Sanity.
  + A base/camp near [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Dens "Spider Dens") can be used in a similar way. This will also provide a lot of monster meat, which can be cooked and fed to an imprisoned bird in a Bird Cage to obtain eggs.
* [Meatballs](/wiki/Meatballs "Meatballs") may be the best Crock Pot dish for Wigfrid, as it's the most cost effective Hunger-wise.
* Wigfrid's Battle Helm and Battle Spear are stronger (and cheaper to make) than the [Spear](/wiki/Spear "Spear") and [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet"). Her items will be outclassed by [Ham Bats](/wiki/Ham_Bat "Ham Bat"), [Shelmets](/wiki/Shelmet "Shelmet") and anything better though.
* A [Pig Village](/wiki/Pig_Village "Pig Village") can be a good resource for Meat early in the game, and it's possible to kill the Pigs with little to no trouble. This can be further improved by feeding the pigs four (4) Monster Meats, which will transform them into [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig") (resulting in more [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") and [Pig Skin](/wiki/Pig_Skin "Pig Skin")).
* During the early days of the game, it can be a good idea to keep a pet [Catcoon](/wiki/Catcoon "Catcoon") and use it to get the aggro of [Koalefants](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant") for easy meat.
* [Pig Villages](/wiki/Pig_Village "Pig Village"), [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") and [Ponds](/wiki/Pond "Pond") are some of the best food sources for Wigfrid.
* Players should try to find the [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King") for infinite amounts of [Gold Nuggets](/wiki/Gold_Nugget "Gold Nugget") for Wigfrid’s gear.
* In DST Wigfrid's [favorite food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Turkey Dinner](/wiki/Turkey_Dinner "Turkey Dinner"), meaning she gains 15 bonus Hunger when eating it.
* Wigfrid can attack [Slurtles](/wiki/Slurtle "Slurtle") while they are in their shells using a hambat or walking cane to safely regenerate her health and sanity.
