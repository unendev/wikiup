**Bug FIxes:**

* Fixed a crash when wolfgang drowns when working out on the gym

  + Added missing Wanda Merrymaker items to shop chests.
  + Added Woven variant of Wolfgang’s Riding Boots. This item will also be added to the appropriate Wolgang shop chests.

Rev. 490507 (Release)

Today we have our next character refresh! We also have some new skins and a new short, new streaming drops, and the return of Winter’s Feast!

Don't Starve Together: The Incredible Strongman
Wolfgang always prided himself on his strength, but after an embarrassing mishap reveals his might to be a touch exaggerated, he finds himself eager to accept any opportunity to get stronger… no matter how dubious the source.

**Here are the details:**

* Instead of being directly connected to his hunger, Wolfgang’s forms are now controlled by a new Might Meter.
  + Filling the Might Meter requires Wolfgang to work out using one of his new craftable items
  + The meter goes down over time and the draining rate is determined by Wolfgang’s Hunger, the hungrier he is, the faster it goes down
* Wolfgang’s linear values are now constants
* Wolfgang freezes and overheats faster when in Wimpy form, but slower while Mighty
* When Mighty Wolfgang can carry heavy items faster. He does not lose Might while carrying heavy objects
* Mighty Wolfgang works faster when chopping wood, mining or hammering things
* Wolfgang is a more efficient rower when Mighty
* His speed no longer changes with his forms
* Wolfgang’s hunger and health are now at a maximum of 200 regardless of his form
* Wolfgang sanity rate changes depending on the number of friends and enemies in his company
* Deals more damage when Mighty and less when Wimpy. Also takes extra damage in Wimpy form
* Wolfgang can build a Gym Station structure
* Player will need to use the gym to gain mightiness
  + Players can load the gym with different heavy items to change its effectiveness
  + Consumes hunger as players work out
  + Wolfgang can craft a consumable Dumbbell item to restore his Might on the go. It does not consume hunger and can be used as a weapon

**A note about this refresh**

When we started these character refreshes, we approached them by saying "This is what we're adding to a character to make people who like that character like them more. We made X more X-like". In this case, we knew (as many players suspected) that Wolfgang was going to need a bit of a nerf. Obviously, that's going to cause some friction, so we approached Wolfgang in a way that would focus his role and improve on the character fantasy rather than just doing what he already did but better. The result is a character that is more specialized and focused on being "The Strongman" both in and out of combat. We're still certainly keeping an eye on feedback, but we'd like you all to give it some time and let us know what you think.

**New Skins!**

Wolfgang Deluxe Wardrobe ($10.99): Including the new "The Incredible Strongman" skinset.
The Merrymaker Survivors Chest, Part II ($9.99) includes 6 new “Merrymaker” skin sets.

**New Streaming Drops!**

We're offering a new set of streaming drops over on Twitch.tv. Check out this post for details.

**Winter’s Feast Has Arrived!**

* An Uncommon Holiday
  + Winter skins have appeared to get our survivors into the winter spirit, and for a limited time, the chances of receiving a rare gift have been substantially increased!
* Festive Holiday Attire
  + For the duration of the Winter's Feast event, players will have access to a free set of skins. The Yuletide Overcoat, Yuletide Frock, Jingly Tophat, Gingerbread Chest, and the Plum Pudding Cap.

**New Klei Rewards!**

Previous year's Winter's Feast twitch skins, the Klaus Cap, and Winter Wardrobe are coming back to the rewards page. As well as the Winter's Feast Lantern. The existing Winter's Feast Lantern is converting to Timeless, and the new Loyal variant is available on the rewards page.

**Oxygen Not Included: Spaced Out! Launches today!**

We are over the moon (read: manic Sparkle Streaking around the studio) to announce that after two years of development, testing, and updates: Oxygen Not Included: Spaced Out! has launched!
Check out the post here for details!

**And last but not least**

We’re getting ready to head out for holiday break soon, and then we’ll be right back to get everybody ready for The Year of the Catcoon event! Have a wonderful Winter’s Feast everyone!

**Changes**

**Fixes:**

* Fixed the crash when wolfgang rows
* Wolfgang can enter the gym, even when danger is near.

Rev. 486561 (Release)

They sure don’t make planes of existence like they used to. One teensy little mishap has plunged the world of Terraria into rather... constant danger, and is terrarizing the Constant like nothing before! Survivors and Terrarians alike will have to keep a watchful eye out… after all, who knows what might slip through the cracks when two worlds collide?

An Eye for An Eye
A crossover collaboration with Re-Logic's Terraria.

A while back during a Reddit AMA to Celebrate Terraria's 10th Anniversary, Re-Logic was asked a simple question. If they could collaborate with any other game franchise, what game would it be? To our surprise and excitement, Don't Starve Together was mentioned in response.

A short while later we reached out to see if this was something they would be interested in, and off we went. Immediately - and I mean, immediately, both teams started spitting out ideas for what we could do and quickly figured out how to work around our planned schedules to make it happen.

For both teams, we saw this opportunity not just as a fun diversion between two studios but also something we thought our fans would really get a kick out of. It was also important that these experiences be additive to our respective games and authentic to each game's design goals.

For the DST Team, we absolutely knew that if we were going to do this crossover any justice we absolutely had to bring a boss (or two?) to the Constant. And, of course, we can't miss the opportunity to put our spin on a bunch of their coolest items.

**Changes:**

* Added the Terrarium, which can be found hidden somewhere in the world.
* Added the Eye of Terror, which can be defeated to obtain Milky Whites and the Eye Mask.
* Added the Twins of Terror, which can be defeated to obtain the Shield of Terror.
* Added new boss statues.
* Added the Suspicious Peeper and the Friendly Peeper.
* Added two new Crock Pot recipes, Frozen Banana Daiquiri and Bunny Stew.
* Added Terraria-themed World Settings and World Generation presets for the Forest and the Caves.
* Added Terraria-themed skins.

Additional Change:

* We also increased the resolution for several older items in the game.

**Eye Wonder**

Somewhere in the game world, survivors may come across the mysterious Terrarium setpiece which will allow players to encounter the Eye of Terror boss, (Terraria's Eye of Cthulu - as seen through the lens of the Constant) complete with its own Terraria inspired theme music.

For our seasoned survivors, the Twins of Terror can be summoned for an added challenge. Each boss has its own unique eye-catching equipment item, and we've also added new statues of these bosses to show off your triumphs.

**Peep this**

We've added a spect-ocular new critter for you to watch over, a new food item to fulfill your survivor's dairy needs, and we have a couple of new crockpot recipes for you to feast your eyes on as well.

**Constant Style**

We have introduced several Terraria item skins into Don't Starve Together as well as a 3 piece character set inspired by Terraria's traveling merchant. Exclusive to the "An Eye for an Eye" update, these skins are definitely out of this world. These item skins cannot be purchased and can only be woven with spool. I hope you have been saving up!

**Get 'em while they're hot!**

Of course, we can't have a bunch of new skins without giving some away, so for a limited time log in to receive the Terrarized chest with 6 free elegant skins! Yep, 6. This login bonus chest will be available for all players to claim until our next update in December.

**A Note from the team at Klei:**

Finally, I want to take this opportunity to thank Re-Logic. Terraria is an amazing game that so many of us, players and developers alike have drawn inspiration from. Thank you for such a great game that has given us so many hours of enjoyment.

The team over at Re-Logic have been absolutely fantastic to work with all the way through this collaboration. It can be a challenge working with new people and figuring out how to get into the groove of a new project, but with Re-Logic we all just hit the ground running and had a blast sharing designs and ideas. Every step of the way both teams shared so much enthusiasm and excitement over what each team was bringing to the update and we are so grateful for the opportunity to bring this to our players. Thank you.

**TERRARIA CROSSOVER UPDATE HIGHLIGHTS**

**THE CONSTANT - A DON'T STARVE INSPIRED WORLD SEED**

The team debated long and hard about the best way to bring the gameplay dynamics of Don't Starve Together into Terraria in a fun and clever way. Rather than having a standalone "event" (as we did with Dungeon Defenders 2), we decided to utilize the World Seed functionality present in Journey's End to create a more holistic Don't Starve x Terraria experience. What awaits you should you dare to explore The Constant?

**Don't Starve Inspired Shaders and Lighting**

**Stay in the Light! Total Darkness is Hazardous to your Health!**

**Feed your Hunger with Tasty Food... or Face the Consequences!**

**Don't Starve Inspired Worldgen**

To explore this new way to play Terraria, Don't Starve Together style, simply enter "The Constant" as your world seed upon creating a new world. Good luck, Terrarians!

**DEERCLOPS - CLIPPING & CLOPPING, HERE COMES A STOMPING!**

You can summon this terrifying foe in the cold climate of the Ice Biome. What awaits you in this fight? Well... you will have to wait and see for yourselves!

**DON'T STARVE TOGETHER INSPIRED ITEMS**

**New Tools & Weapons - Including Lucy the Axe**

**New Pets & Summons**

**Chester - A Pet that Functions As a Piggy Bank**

Together we are worked through Klei's merchandise partners at FreshMerch on this series of crossover merchandise items, using the key art for this update! Click the images below to check out and pick up anything that catches your eye!

* Fixed Wurt’s tentacle warning not working correctly.
* Fixed all servers showing “Day Unknown” for the day count in the server browser.

Rev. 482709 (Release)

Hey Everybody,

Today we have a pretty great QOL update, Hallowed Nights returns, and some new spooooky skins.

As we've mentioned before, we had different plans for this month, but we needed to move things around a bit and so we rescheduled that for next month and added a bonus QOL update in its place!

**Quality of Life Update!**

* Server admins and local hosts can now pause the game.
* Chat now has a history of the last 100 messages and persists between the character select screen, forest, and caves.
* Added profanity filtering. This can be disablled in the options menu or configured in your Steam Community Content Preferences.
* All creatures can now be affected by buffs
* The Bee Queen Crown, Bone Armor, Bone Helm, Shadow Thurible, and Spiderhat can now be deconstructed.
* Growth Formula Starter and Composting Bin now require an Alchemy Engine to prototype.
* Reduced the ingredients for crafting the Premier Gardeneer Hat and Moon Rock Walls
* Improved the Pick/Axe's durability and damage.
* Moongleams and Infused Moon Shards now take longer to spoil.
* Mouse and Keyboard actions can now be unbound in the controls option menu.

**Bug Fix Highlights!**

* Fixed a bug causing mods between the server and client to desync when starting a server with a poor connection to steam.
* Fixed a bug where Wigfrid would gain inspiration twice when using ranged attacks
* Wigfrid now properly calculates inspiration based on the actual damage done. This means buffs, debuffs, and electric damage now affect her inspiration gain. The target's buffs and protective states, like a hiding Slurtle, will also affect her inspiration gain. Note: The inspiration gain rate has been adjusted to account for her natural +25% damage multiplier.
* Fixed a save/load issue with the Fire Staff and Ice Staff projectiles.
* Fixed a bug where the Winged Sail would not save/load its state when built on land.
* Fixed a bug where spiderdens on boats could grow again if you removed den decorations from them.

* Fixed a movement speed bug when amphibious creatures are in the water and fail to jump onto a boat.
* Fixed a bug allowing the wardrobe to reskin your character to other characters skins.
* Slow-Down Rounds now work on phase 2 of the Celestial Champion.
* Fixed a bug causing retargeting (while holding F) to not take into account whether the creature is dead.
* Fixed a crash when dying from the Celestial Altar by hammering it during a moonstorm..
* Fixed a bug causing Skitter Squids to go invisible when thawing out from being frozen in the water.

You can find the full patch notes here:

**Server Pausing:**

* Server admins and local hosts can now pause the game.
  + This can be done via a keybind that defaults to ‘P’ or when more than one player is on the server, by the “Not a pause” Pause Screen.
* When playing by yourself, on a server you locally host or are an admin for, the game can now automatically pause (“Auto-Pause”) when focus is taken away from the world.
  + For example: the “Not a pause” Pause Screen, cookbook, wardrobe, map, etc.
  + While other players are in the world, auto-pausing will be disabled.
* When the game is paused, you can:
  + Manage your inventory
  + View crafting recipes
  + Look at the map
  + Talk to other players via ingame chat
  + Disconnect
* Servers that are paused will show up as such in the server browser, and can be filtered based on that setting.
* Worlds hosted without caves will now be paused while all players are in the lobby.

**Notes for Modders:**

* You can hide the darkened pause underlay via the console command:
  + Profile:SetHidePauseUnderlay(true)
* You can enable and disable the Console Command Screen auto-pausing separately in the Advanced menu in settings.
* When the game is paused, you can run the command TheNet:AdvanceFrame() to make the game advance forward one Update(dt) call.
* The game now has a new update loop: StaticUpdate(dt) StaticUpdate will run regardless of the game being paused.
  + Components now also have support for a OnStaticUpdate call, but this will only be executed when the game is paused, and will be skipped when the game is unpaused.
* There is a new Scheduler called staticScheduler, this Scheduler is identical to the normal scheduler, except that it runs on the StaticUpdate loop, and not the Update loop, meaning it will update while the game is paused.
* EntityScript now has a DoStaticPeriodicTask and DoStaticTaskInTime functions, these are identical to their non-static counterparts, except that because they run on StaticUpdate, they will run even when paused.

* If your widget/screen should continue to behave normally while paused, you will need to make all the following changes to it:

  + Why is DST’s own text getting filtered? This would be a bug, please report the issue in the bug tracker.

**Hallowed Nights Returns!**

Players can once again discover tricks and treats around The Constant. Fill your candy bag to the brim and satisfy your sweet tooth with all sorts of sugary seasonal treats! The event remains largely the same as last year although we did add a treat or two.

Free spooky costumes are also available for a limited time, so enjoy them before the event ends and they go back from whence they came!

That's not all. During Hallowed Nights, logging in for the first time will earn you "The Trick or Treat Chest" containing one of 18 heirloom costume sets. More Trick or Treat Chests can be earned by using the Trade-Inn with a significantly increased chance for elegant items.

A new set of Survivors has had costumes added to the Costume Collection. The Survivors Costume Chest, Part II ($9.99usd/16 RMB).

**New Streaming Drops!**

We are adding the "Monstrous Horror" skin to the Nautical Collection. For more information on streaming drops and how to get them, check out the post here.

**And finally**

As we head towards the holidays, we have our seasonal events coming up. We also have a super-secret project that we have been super careful not to leak that we absolutely cannot reveal at the moment. We will also be doing another Costume and Art submission event later this month. In addition to that, the team is well on their way toward the Wolfgang refresh for December along with the usual Winter Festivities.

Now it's time to share our usual vague teaser for the next update. Sorry to be so cryptic this time, but who knows, maybe you can figure it out!

## **September 27, 2021 - October 2021 QoL Beta**[]

Rev. 480096 (Test)

We had something else we were hoping to release this month, however we're going to need a little bit more time for that, so we're throwing in a surprise QOL update. The Beta Branch is open again, this time with the October QoL changes that will be coming with Hallowed Nights next month.

The game is paused! Seriously it is! No seriously, with this update you can pause the game! It also contains many improvements to the chat, allowing you to view a recent history of messages sent in chat, along with maintaining your chat history when you go to the caves from the forest, or vice versa.

You can follow the directions here to join the beta.

**Server Pausing:**

**Changes:**

* Server admins and local hosts can now pause the game.
  + This can be done via a keybind that defaults to ‘P’ or when more than one player is on the server, by the “Not a pause” Pause Screen.
* When playing by yourself, on a server you locally host or are an admin for, the game can now automatically pause (“Auto-Pause”) when focus is taken away from the world.
  + For example: the “Not a pause” Pause Screen, cookbook, wardrobe, map, etc.
* While other players are in the world, auto-pausing will be disabled.
* When the game is paused, you can:
  + Manage your inventory
  + View crafting recipes
  + Look at the map
  + Talk to other players via ingame chat
  + Disconnect
* Servers that are paused will show up as such in the server browser, and can be filtered based on that setting.
* Worlds hosted without caves will now be paused while all players are in the lobby.

**Notes for Modders:**

* You can hide the darkened pause underlay via the console command:
  + Profile:SetHidePauseUnderlay(true)
* You can enable and disable the Console Command Screen auto-pausing separately in the Advanced menu in settings.
* When the game is paused, you can run the command TheNet:AdvanceFrame() to make the game advance forward one Update(dt) call.
* The game now has a new update loop: StaticUpdate(dt), StaticUpdate will run regardless of the game being paused.
  + Components now also have support for a OnStaticUpdate call, but this will only be executed when the game is paused, and will be skipped when the game is unpaused.
* There is a new Scheduler called staticScheduler, this Scheduler is identical to the normal scheduler, except that it runs on the StaticUpdate loop, and not the Update loop, meaning it will update while the game is paused.
* EntityScript now has a DoStaticPeriodicTask and DoStaticTaskInTime functions, these are identical to their non-static counterparts, except that because they run on StaticUpdate, they will run even when the game is paused.
* All widgets and screens will now use DoStaticPeriodicTask and DoStaticTaskInTime by default.
* Widgets and screens also have a DoSimPeriodicTask and DoSimTaskInTime, which will pause and stop updating when the game is paused.
* Widgets and screens have a new function called UpdateWhilePaused, which is by default called with true, if called with false, DoPeriodicTask and DoTaskInTime will now point to their Sim variants instead of the Static variants.
* All widget OnUpdate(dt) calls will need to check TheNet:IsServerPaused() if their behavior should stop updating when the game is paused.
* All AnimState’s have a AnimateWhilePaused function, by default all normal in game objects won’t animate while the game is paused, and all widgets and screens will animate when paused, you can use this call AnimState:AnimateWhilePaused(animate\_while\_paused) to set the correct behavior for your animations.

If your widget/screen should continue to behave normally while paused, you will need to make all the following changes to it:

* Replace any reference to scheduler with staticScheduler.
* Replace any call to GetTime with GetStaticTime.
* Replace any call to GetTick with GetStaticTick.

If your widget/screen should pause when the game pauses, you will need to make the following changes to it:

* If you have an OnUpdate(dt) call, add the following to the first line in the function:
* TheNet:IsServerPaused() then return end
* Call self:UpdateWhilePaused(false) on the widget/screen, and on any child widgets that need to pause when the game is paused.
* Call AnimState:AnimateWhilePaused(false) on any widgets that have an AnimState.

If you want your screen to autopause the game, you must do the following:

* Add the following code to the constructor of your screen:
  + SetAutopaused(true)
* Add/Create the following to the OnDestroy function of your screen:
  + SetAutopaused(false)
* If the top center of your screen is being used, you can move the server paused text to somewhere else by adding this function to your screen:
  + function YourScreen:OffsetServerPausedWidget(serverpausewidget)
  + And then call serverpausewidget:SetOffset(x, y) inside the function.

**Changes:**

* Announcements and Skin Announcements will now show up in the chat queue instead of at the top of the screen.

The target’s buffs and protective states, like a hiding Slurtle, will also affect her inspiration gain. Note: The inspiration gain rate has been adjusted to account for her natural +25% damage multiplier.
* Fixed a bug where the Winged Sail would not save/load its state when built on land.

**New Streaming Drops!**

We are adding the "Skittersquid Helm" skin to the Nautical Collection. For more information on streaming drops and how to get them, check out the post here.

**Coming up next!**

Ok - I can't say a lot about what's coming up next. We have some pretty significant QOL stuff coming. We also have our regular Hallowed Nights event and we'll be doing another costume submission event as well.

Oh, and our next character refresh is Wolfgang coming up in December. So there's that. Which is nice. I am sure nobody is going to have an opinion on that so It's probably barely worth mentioning.

I don't have a teaser image today, because of reasons I can't say right now. But we're neck-deep in work to prepare for our busiest time of the year, so we've got a lot coming up for you over the next couple of months.

And finally, here is a link for some Klei rewards points. Use them wisely!

Left adrift at sea in the sweltering heat, our Survivors thought they were surely done for. And perhaps they would have been if luck hadn’t landed them beneath the protective boughs of an enormous tree. A tree that, remarkably, seemed to spring from the ocean itself. Believing themselves to be saved, the Survivors began collecting the bounty of fruit and materials the great tree had to offer, not realizing that they were not the only ones to have found safe harbor beneath the canopy...

**What's Next?**

Good question. The Team has been hard at work on the next few updates. It's almost *time* to introduce you to Wanda, the new character DLC that will come to the game in the first half of September. We also have a new special thing we have never done before that we're pretty excited about for October that is super secret. Ok, so I just realized I can't really talk about anything we have coming up next, but things are about to get interesting.

We also have some exciting new stuff planned for Klei Rewards, so save up those points!

**Update 474494 Patch Notes:**

**Other Boat Changes:**

**Technical Details:**

* Boats speed calculations are now more consistent, so your speed won’t fluctuate up and down.
* The following of platforms(boats) is now handled in the engine instead of in lua.
* When boats are drifting(moving without a player on them) they will do a scan around them to turn on the physics of nearby objects.
* When boats entity sleep all sails on a boat will get closed.
* In the engine, platform following now properly supports rotation(as in objects would rotate around a boat when a boat is rotated), this however is not yet used in the base game.
* Embarking can now fail if the embarked position gets too far away from the player(IE two boats moving at top speed past each other and trying to hop would now fail)

**Notes For Modders**

* The walkableplatform and boatphysics component have been significantly changed, mods modifying these components will probably need to be rewritten.
* Mods can enable boats to rotate from the steering wheel by calling BoatPhysics:SetCanSteeringRotate(true)
* Several events that boats used to push for all entities on a boat are now only pushed for players.
* For any entity that can get attached to a platform, EntityScript:GetCurrentPlatform() should be used instead of TheWorld.Map:GetPlatformAtPoint(...)

The next update, Waterlogged, is up on the beta branch. Enjoy some shaded reprieve from the heat. Mind the bugs.

Go here to learn how to enter into the beta branch.

**Added the Waterlogged ocean biome**

* Great Tree Trunk
* Knobbly Trees
* Fig, with new recipes
* Grassgator
* Sea Strider

**Added a 64 bit version of the game.**

**Boat Changes:**

**Changes:**

* All boats will now eventually come to a stop, regardless of whether it has an anchor or not.
* Doubled the top speed of boats.
* Greatly improved the performance on worlds with lots of boats(depending on the number of boats, as much as a 50% improvement in total performance).
* Boats will now properly collide with all objects while offscreen.
* When logging back in, players will now respawn on the boat they logged off on, regardless of whether it has moved since they logged off.

**Technical Details:**

* Boats speed calculations are now more consistent, so your speed won’t fluctuate up and down.

* When boats are drifting(moving without a player on them) they will do a scan around them to turn on the physics of nearby objects.
* When boats entity sleep all sails on a boat will get closed.
* In the engine, platform following now properly supports rotation(as in objects would rotate around a boat when a boat is rotated), this however is not yet used in the base game.

**Notes For Modders:**

* The walkableplatform and boatphysics component have been significantly changed, mods modifying these components will probably need to be rewritten.
* Mods can enable boats to rotate from the steering wheel by calling BoatPhysics:SetCanSteeringRotate(true)
* Several events that boats used to push for all entities on a boat are now only pushed for players.
* For any entity that can get attached to a platform, EntityScript:GetCurrentPlatform() should be used instead of TheWorld.Map:GetPlatformAtPoint(...)

We have identified the source of the problem and are working on a fix so it will not happen again. We also have a plan to automatically restore the worlds affected by this but it will probably not be ready until Monday. Until then, if you feel tech savvy, you can follow the instructions below to restore your worlds. And remember to backup your save files first. Thank you to everyone who provided bug reports on the issue.

**Instructions:**

* In the host server screen, click on the open folder button (it is above the delete button)
  + **< ! Backup this folder or you run the risk of losing your world permanently ! >**
* Within the Cluster folder, navigate to Master/save/session/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/
  + xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is a 16 digit series of numbers and letters. If you have multiple folders, you can search the server\_log.txt to see which number is referenced.
* In this folder:
  + write down the highest number of the files located here (not including the folders). Eg: 0000000032 and 0000000032.meta
  + Delete the other number files (do not delete the folders or GemCoreTileData if it exists)
* Now navigate to Caves/save/session/yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy/
  + yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy is a different 16 digits from what is in master
* In this folder:
  + Find the highest number of the files located here and change the filename to match the numbers that were in master. Eg: 0000000032 and 0000000032.meta
  + Delete the other number files (do not delete the folders or GemCoreTileData if it exists)
* Restart DST
* You should now be able to load your world. If it does not work, then restore your backed up files and try again.

Rev. 458469 (Release)

Today we have our next character refresh! We also have some new skins and a new short. No foolin'!

**Don't Starve Together: C'est La Vie**

Some people just seem to attract more than their fair share of bad luck... and even those people are grateful they aren't Wes.

Last year Wes received a character refresh that was largely divisive among members of the community. While our intention was to give him the proper attention he deserves, we didn't sufficiently focus on changes that really emphasize the essence of who *Wes* really is.

**Here are the details:**

* Wes now has a Balloonomancy crafting tab where he can inflate various types of balloons
  + Balloon - The same old balloons, now with a few more shapes
  + Speedy Balloon - An overly inflated balloon to help become lighter on your feet, but don’t let go!
  + Party Balloon - Gather some friends and pop these to host a small party
  + Inflatable Vest - Acts as a life jacket, preventing damage from falling in the ocean.
  + Balloon Hat - Just a little dapper with some rain protection, and completes your balloon outfit
* Now has the lowest stats of all the survivors
* Hounds waves will focus more on Wes than the other survivors.
* Is more susceptible to overheating and freezing
* Takes longer to recover from grogginess
* Has a higher chance of being struck by lightning
* Is less efficient at mining, chopping, and hammering
* Tools and weapons used by Wes will not wear out as fast
* No longer suffers from an increase in hunger drain
* Removed the 100 balloon per world limit

**More details:**

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed a crash if the player died to electrocution damage.
* Fixed a bug causing the beefalos that deplete all the saltlicks around them to start losing domestication at a rate as if no salt licks were ever around them.
* Fixed a bug causing beefalos to lose domestication 10 times faster than they should.
* The Sea Fishing Rod, Trusty Slingshot, Tackle Box and Spectackler Box can now be eaten by Eyeplants.
* Fixed a bug causing certain creature spawners (Hound Mounds, Beehives, Spiderdens, ect) to not always spawn their respective creatures.

**Notes for Modders:**

* AnimState:SetSortOrder() now takes a range of -3 to 3
* AnimState:SetFinalOffset() now takes a range of -7 to 7
* Added the component “efficientuser” to allow players to modify the amount of uses consumed on the equipped item when performing actions.
* Added the component “houndedtarget” to allow weighted selection when assigning spawns during a Hound or Depths Worm wave.
* Added loyaltyeffectiveness to the leader component which scales the duration an NPC will follow the player for when fed
* Recipes can now define “dropitem = true” to cause crafted items to be dropped instead of going into the player’s inventory.

**New Skins!**

**Wes Deluxe Wardrobe** ($10.99): The Deluxe wardrobe contains the Fool, Guest of Honor, Triumphant, Survivor and Roseate skins for Wes.

**The Fool's Tool Chest** contains skins for the Walking Cane, Top Hat, and Pan Flute. **$3.99** (8 CNY)

**Streaming Drops!**

In case you missed it, we're offering a new set of streaming drops over on Twitch.tv. Check out this post for details.

**Login Bonus!**

We thought that it would be appropriate to do a login bonus centered around how much everybody feels about Wes, so for a limited time, players that login during this time will receive **nothing**.

**Still Salty?**

The Salt Box Shaker has been added to Klei Rewards. Here is a link for 1200 points, Valid until May 1st.

**Coming Up!**

I can't get into details right now. But the team is working toward finishing the Return of Them arc. Obviously this means a lot of things and more info will come soon, but I thought it would be nice to reveal the hidden image from the roadmap. What is it? Who made it? Why does it matter? You'll find out soon.

Rev. 455433 (Release)

Hey everybody.

We're back with another QOL update, this update contains some changes to world options, they have been split into two categories, world settings (things affect the world after it has been generated), and world generation options (things that affect world generation). By default, saving and loading presets will work as before, or can choose to unlink the world settings and generation options and manage their presets separately. If you host a dedicated server, the method for applying world options is unchanged and will continue to work just fine.

**Changes**

* Containers can now be opened by multiple players at the same time.
* All actions can be repeated by clicking and holding the action button.
* All crafting recipes can be repeated by double clicking and holding the crafting button.
* Setting world generation options to “More” will no longer generate more of that object in every biome, it will now only generate more of that object in biomes where that object already exists.
* World settings, (things that affect game behavior after the world has been generated) can now be changed after a world has been generated.
* The preset menu has been overhauled to allow custom presets to be named.
* Added over 20 new world generation options.
* Added over 60 new world settings.
* The server commands menu (eg. roll back, regenerate the world, etc) is now accessible via the “Server Commands” button in the not-a-pause pause menu.
* The rescue command has been added to the Server Commands menu.
* The player listing screen (scoreboard) can now also be accessed via the not-a-pause pause menu
* Added world settings to assist players when joining someone’s server. These settings should only have an impact on public servers. If you are locally hosting your own private world that only you and some friends play on, your experience will not be affected.
  + Extra Starting Resources. New players joining a world after day 10 will start with a few extra resources to make up for the starting area being most likely picked clean.
  + Seasonal Starting Items. New players joining a world that is not in autumn will receive a basic seasonal clothing item to help them survive long enough to get started.
  + Spawn Protection. When a player spawns in, if there are too many structures near the spawn point or if there are hostile creatures, the player will gain a temporary buff that allows them to walk through structures and prevents them from being targeted.
  + Drop Items on Despawn. Sets whether a player will drop only irreplaceable items or drop all their items when they leave the server.
* Year of the Beefalo has ended.
* Beefalo bell has been moved into the tools crafting menu,
* Beefalo groomer has been moved into the structures crafting menu. Recipe changed a little.
* The Year of the Beefalo skins are available all the time now.

**Bug Fixes**

* Ice now floats
* Lesser Glow Berries now have a different animation on the ground.
* Fixed a bug causing birchnut trees to update when they shouldn’t

**Notes For Modders**

* The worlddeciduoustreeupdater component is now deprecated
* You can see this post for the modding api changes made in this update.

**Workshop API Upgrade**

The Steam Workshop API has been upgraded, this provides the following improvements:

* Mods will be smaller in file size, along with downloading faster.
* Updates won’t require redownloading the whole mod, instead only the changes are downloaded.
* The File limits imposed by the previous API are gone.
* Mods will be automatically updated by the steam client without the game even needing to be open.
* The Mods Tab should perform better due to using the faster API for getting mod info.

**More Victorian Skins!**

The gang's all here! The rest of the survivors get the Victorian treatment in the Latecomers' Victorian Chest for $7.99 or you can get the Complete Victorian chest for $24.99usd. I don't know about you, but I need that Wortox skin, like now.

**New Login Bonuses!**

We have a new login bonus for you. The worm Riddled Chest contains the Snaggletooth Wormhole, Lureplant Wormhole, Arachnoid Wormhole and Glow Berry Bush skins just for logging in to the game.

**And this week's Klei Rewards link!**

Twitch drops are still on Hiatus but hopefully, we'll have some news pretty soon about their return. But for now, have 1700 points and get something cool. (Link expires on 3/18/2021)

**And that's it for now.**

We're not quite ready to show you what we're working on just yet, but we will post something as soon as we've got something ready. Until then, have fun out there!
