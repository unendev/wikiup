## Minimap Maxwell's Door Origin[]

**“**Wanda has been trying to outrun her future for longer than she can remember - but after a split-second decision left her tangled up in the Constant's timestream, it might be her past that's finally catching up to her...**”**

–From the description for *Long Shadows*

 File:Don%27t Starve Together- Long Shadows -Wanda Animated Short- 

Don't Starve Together- Long Shadows -Wanda Animated Short-

 

Wanda's backstory is revealed in the animated short *[Long Shadows](/wiki/Animated_shorts_and_trailers#Long_Shadows "Animated shorts and trailers")*, the details of which are summarized in her biography from the [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium"):

*An enigmatic woman of... well, fluctuating age, Wanda was torn from the world she knew after accidentally creating a fracture in time and space, pulling her from her own timeline into the land of the Constant. Though she avoids divulging many details of her past with the other Survivors, she seems to have an odd familiarity with them, as though she's run into them before... or perhaps, later?*

## Placeholder Trivia[]

### In-Game[]

* Wanda is voiced by grandfather clock chimes.
  + When Wanda is in old age, her voice becomes distorted and has a vibrato effect.
* Wanda is the only DLC human character in *Don't Starve Together*.
* Klei Ambassadors got early access to Wanda before the rest of the players. They were able to stream and release videos about her starting September 7, 2021.
* Using the [Grim Galette](/wiki/Grim_Galette "Grim Galette") as Wanda gives the player the standard stats of eating it, but does not actually swap age and sanity upon consumption.
* Wanda does not suffer a max health penalty from drowning or items such as [Telltale Heart](/wiki/Telltale_Heart "Telltale Heart") or using [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern") to revive. As such, Wanda has no use for the [Booster Shot](/wiki/Booster_Shot "Booster Shot").
* Wanda may be ethnically South Asian or Middle Eastern, judging from her skin tone, and her use of the word 'baba', a term found in said cultures, when examining [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy").
* In the animation of Wanda dying, the hands on the clock in the X and Z axes turn into flat Shadow Hands in the X and Y axes.

### Lore[]

* Her quotes constantly refer to the fact that she's in a hurry somewhere, despite some abilities associated with time.
* She seems to have experienced [Wagstaff](/wiki/Grainy_Transmission "Grainy Transmission") picking up the [Lunar Essence Extractor](/wiki/Grainy_Transmission#Lunar_Essence_Extractor "Grainy Transmission") with lunar energy in a previous timeline.[[3]](#cite_note-3)
* Apparently, she made some kind of deal with a "mysterious entity" which gave her the knowledge of using shadow magic for time travel. Wanda also states how she wasn't told about the green gems before. She also says: "There's no need to be afraid of curses if you're clever enough to outsmart them."
* In her examination quote for Festive Lights, Wanda mentions "electric candles". "Electric candle" is another name for Yablochkov candles, a type of arc lamp invented in 1876 by Russian inventor Pavel Nikolayevich Yablochkov, with her examination quote seeming to imply that she originates from not long after their invention.
