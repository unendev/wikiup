|  | The article may contain **outdated and inaccurate information**. You may want to help improve the content by adding updated information. |

This page lists all **non-renewable** [items](/wiki/Items "Items") in the game that can be used up or their only sources can be depleted. This does not include items and structures further crafted from these items. Nearly all resources which were once non-renewable in [Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve") have been made renewable in [Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together").

All items that are *not* included in this list are **renewable** resources. Renewable resources can still end up unavailable if the mob or plant providing it goes **extinct**.
