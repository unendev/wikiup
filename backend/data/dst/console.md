Opened console in the game

 

**Console** is a developer interface in *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* and *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. Players can open a console menu by pressing **~** ( English/French), **^** or **ö** (German Keyboard Layout) **æ** or **ø** (Scandinavian Keyboard) or **ù** (Azerty Keyboard Layout) and "Ñ" in the Spanish Keyboard. It can be hid again by pressing ***Ctrl + L***. However, the feature must be enabled in the settings file located at the following location:

```
Windows, Mac:  <Documents>\Klei\DoNotstarve\settings.ini
Linux:         ~/.klei/DoNotStarve/settings.ini

```

Opening settings.ini, players should make the following changes:

```
[MISC]
ENABLECONSOLE = true

```

If a player wishes to disable the console once it has been enabled they will have to navigate to "\dont\_starve\data\scripts\main.lua" and set the "CONSOLE\_ENABLED" line to false.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The Console is not available in *[The Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge")* event servers for *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. Also, none of its exclusive prefabs can be used in a regular world, making anything exclusive to *The Forge* impossible to spawn.
