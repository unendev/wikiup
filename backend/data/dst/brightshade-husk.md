## Tips[]

* Brightshade husk can be easily farmed by planting Dragon Fruit seeds very closely to the [Magma](/wiki/Magma "Magma"), as they are fire resistant. Because Deadly Brightshades focus over plants placed by the players, they will die from the passive fire damage caused by the Magma, when inhabiting them. This can result having lots of Brightshade Husk so it's important to visit the Magma from time to time.
