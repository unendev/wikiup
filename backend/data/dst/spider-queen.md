## Behavior[]

The Spider Queen spawns from overgrown tier 3 [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") when the player or other [mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") wander close by. After spawning, she will give birth to [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider") every 20 seconds, and if the queen has a combat target, a third of these will be [Spider Warriors](/wiki/Spider_Warrior "Spider Warrior"). A Queen can have a maximum of 16 spiders following her. These spiders are automatically aggressive towards the player, but will retreat back to the Queen if the player gains enough distance away from them.

When a Spider Queen spawns, her Tier 3 den is replaced with a Tier 1 Den, unless there are 4 or more dens/queens within 60[m](/wiki/Tile "Tile"). This tier 1 den grows into a tier 2 den in 60 seconds. The new den can eventually grow into a tier 3 den to spawn another Queen. The Queen will plant herself as a tier 1 den after wandering for 1.5 game [days](/wiki/Day "Day") as long as she finds a free space with a radius of 3m that is 20m away from other dens/queens.

[Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") will not be attacked by a Queen or her Spiders, unless he attacks first.

A Spider Queen is not nocturnal like other spiders, and will fall asleep at [night](/wiki/Night "Night") if not engaged in combat.

Spider Queens (and the spiders spawned by them) are hostile towards [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester"), even if Webber is carrying the Eye Bone.

### Don't Starve Together Don't Starve Together[]

The Spider Queen will give birth to Spiders twice as fast, doing so every 10 seconds. If the Spider Queen has a combat target, she has a 22.5% chance to spawn [Nurse Spiders](/wiki/Nurse_Spider "Nurse Spider"), 22.5% chance to spawn Spider Warrior, 55% chance to spawn normal spider.

Spider Queen spawning from tier 3 dens can be accelerated by haunting the den. There is 10% chance of a haunt causing tier 3 den to become Spider Queen.

## Strategy[]

### Kiting[]

Kiting is a process wherein a monster's attack is dodged, and then the monster is hit immediately after, but before the monster can attack again. The Spider Queen attacks relatively quickly, but she is slow, so it is possible to attack her in the pauses between attacks. The recently birthed Spiders/Spider Warriors should be always killed first before attempting to attack the Queen again. As always, good [armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor") and [weapons](/wiki/Weapon "Weapon") help a lot. If fighting without armor, having a couple of [Traps](/wiki/Trap "Trap") set around to kill the spawned spiders is a good idea. However, the Spider Queen can drain the [Character](/wiki/Character "Character")'s sanity (unless they are [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") or [Walter](/wiki/Walter "Walter")) completely within thirty seconds (200 sanity), so it is advisable to keep the distance somewhat. Sanity-restoring items such as [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy") and [Cooked Green Caps](/wiki/Cooked_Green_Cap "Cooked Green Cap") can be brought to counter the sanity drain.

### Pigs[]

The Spider Queen can be lured to a [Pig Village](/wiki/Pig_Village "Pig Village") to let the [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") attack her. Due to the kiting combat behavior of Pigs, the Queen and her spawned spiders have trouble hitting them. As long as the spiders she hatches are kept away from the Pigs, they should kill her quite quickly. This method also can prevent serious sanity drain.

### Tentacles[]

If there happens to be a [Swamp](/wiki/Swamp "Swamp") nearby, the Spider Queen can be lured to the swamp and over the [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle") as they attack most mobs that pass by. About 3-5 Tentacles could be killed in this process.

### Beefalo[]

If there is a herd of [Beefalos](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") in heat nearby, the Spider Queen can be lured close enough to them for at least one Beefalo to target her, the whole herd will eventually join in on the Queen. The Beefalos will not eat the meat dropped like pigs do. However, due to the fact that Beefalos don't use a kite method of attack like pigs, the Queen will stand her ground and be able to kill at least 3-4 Beefalos single-handedly. Wearing a [Beefalo Hat](/wiki/Beefalo_Hat "Beefalo Hat") will allow the player to retrieve the drops without being attacked in the process.

### Spiders[]

If the player has a [Spiderhat](/wiki/Spiderhat "Spiderhat"), it is possible to gather spider allies from [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") and order them to attack the Queen. This is very useful for when on low health. If playing as the character Webber, all the player must do is simply tame spiders with meat instead.

### Bees[]

The Spider Queen can be lured to a [Killer Bee Hive](/wiki/Killer_Bee_Hive "Killer Bee Hive"), as [Killer Bees](/wiki/Killer_Bees "Killer Bees") have the same kiting technique as Pigs do. When a Killer Bee attacks the Queen, and she strikes back, all nearby bees will become aggressive to the Queen, including normal [Bees](/wiki/Bee "Bee"). Bees can also be captured using a [Bug Net](/wiki/Bug_Net "Bug Net") and released near the Queen. [Bee Mines](/wiki/Bee_Mines "Bee Mines") are another option to ensure that the bees will attack her, though they are more costly to craft than the net.

### Lureplant[]

If there is a [Lureplant](/wiki/Lureplant "Lureplant") that has produced a meat lure or a Leafy Meat, it is possible to have the Spider Queen follow the player and, if any, her Spiders and Spider Warriors toward the Lureplant. The Lureplant's many [Eyeplants](/wiki/Eyeplant "Eyeplant") will attack any of the spiders, including the Spider Queen, that come within their range of attack. Because Eyeplants are able to respawn, they will pop up elsewhere and be able to continue attacking as long as spiders are within their radius. Also, since the Lureplant itself is not capable of attacking or defending itself, it won't be seen as a threat, and will not be attacked. Eyeplants will continue to reappear when destroyed, until the Spider Queen dies and no spiders are left. Once the Spider Queen is killed by the Lureplant, the player must destroy it in order to obtain all the items that the Spider Queen has dropped upon death (if those were consumed by Eyeplants).

### Blow Darts[]

This is the easiest way to defeat the Spider Queen. Make 13 [Blow Darts](/wiki/Blow_Dart "Blow Dart") (25 in Don't Starve Together) and shoot the Spider Queen as fast as possible, without letting her or her spiders catch up.

### Pan Flute[]

The [Pan Flute](/wiki/Pan_Flute "Pan Flute") can be used to put the Spider Queen and her Spiders to sleep. The queen will remain asleep if the player attacks the spiders around her. With the Pan Flute's 10 uses providing intermittent chances to clear all of the queen's spider spawns, it is far easier to engage the queen one on one.

### Gunpowder[]

The Spider Queen can be easily killed by freezing her with an Ice Staff, placing 5 [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder") near her, lighting it on fire, and then finishing her off with a [Spear](/wiki/Spear "Spear"). However, if she is killed with 6 Gunpowder or more (12 or more in Don't Starve Together), all she will drop is [Ashes](/wiki/Ashes "Ashes") and [Cooked Monster Meat](/wiki/Cooked_Monster_Meat "Cooked Monster Meat"), since she took fire damage after the explosion, and thus, died by fire.

### Number of Hits[]

Below is the number of hits it takes with each weapon to kill a Spider Queen when playing with characters with a default damage modifier. The [Weather Pain](/wiki/Weather_Pain "Weather Pain") is not included due to the random nature of its projectile.

## Tips[]

* Spider Queens will not aggro if spiders around them are attacked. This allows players to draw their attention and isolate the queen for a one on one fight if they can get the spiders to aggro without getting too close to the queen.
* When playing as [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") in the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC, the Spider Queen is the best way to spread Spider Dens around the map, by letting the initial den from his [Spider Eggs](/wiki/Spider_Eggs "Spider Eggs") grow, and waiting for her to create another den in the map, this allows safer harvesting of [Silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk") and [Spider Glands](/wiki/Spider_Gland "Spider Gland") rather than dealing with the more powerful [Spider Monkeys](/wiki/Spider_Monkey "Spider Monkey"), which are hostile towards Webber.

## Trivia[]

* Real world spiders have eight legs, but the spider queen only has six. This is a trend with all of the variations of Spiders in *Don't Starve*. same with their eyes, unlike the real ones, only normal and warriors have 8 eyes, the others usually have less or more in [one case](/wiki/Shattered_Spider "Shattered Spider")
* In real life, there are few species of social spiders, none of which have a queen. The queens seen in *Don't Starve* are similar to queen bees, ants, and even termites.
* As a giant female spider, the Spider Queen is similar in appearance to Shelob from the *Lord of the Rings* books.
* Spiders in her entourage will seem to 'cower' before her, with their legs raised and their faces fearful. This behavior also occurs when the player wears the Spiderhat, or befriends Spiders while playing as Webber.
* [Webber's quote](/wiki/Webber_quotes "Webber quotes") may be a reference to the real world spider known as a Daddy Longlegs.

## Bugs[]

* Fighting other mobs in the presence of a Spider Queen will cause "E.F.S." (the boss monster song) to play. As long as the player is not within her (and her spiders') aggro radius, the Spider Queen does not become aggressive to the player. This also applies to fighting near a [Treeguard](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard").
* Sometimes, when the Spider Queen is killed as she plants herself, she'll drop loot but still will leave a den.
  + Sometimes, she'll also try to and often succeed in birthing a new spider before she fully disappears.
* Sometimes, when the Den is destroyed with loot dropping, the Spider Queen will still spawn before the Den fully disappears.
* If a Spider Queen emerges from a Spider Den that is too close to the ocean, it's possible for the Spider Queen to appear on the water, and not be able to get back on land.
* If a Spider Queen is spawning a spider while frozen, she may be stuck in a loop of spawning the spider until she dies.
