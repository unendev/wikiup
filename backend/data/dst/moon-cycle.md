The **Moon Cycle** is a gameplay mechanic which affects the appearance of [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig") and [Woodie's](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie") transformation. Werepigs are normal [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") who are caught outdoors during a full moon, and Woodie turns into a Werebeaver whenever there's a full moon.

During a full moon, [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester") will transform into either a Shadow Chester if he has at least one [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") in every inventory slot or a Snow Chester if he has at least one [Blue Gem](/wiki/Blue_Gem "Blue Gem") in every slot.

The complete Moon Cycle lasts for 16 [Days](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle") and then repeats (20 days in [DST](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")). Each phase of the Moon lasts for two [Nights](/wiki/Night "Night").

In all [DLCs](/wiki/DLC "DLC"), several additional changes can be observed on a full moon. The moon casts down a dim, blue-tinted light over the world, so the player can safely explore without a light source and fear of [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie"). [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms") will turn into [Mushtrees](/wiki/Mushtree "Mushtree"). [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") will turn into [Evil Flowers](/wiki/Evil_Flower "Evil Flower") (But will revert back from the 3/4 Gibbous days onwards). The eyes on [Pig](/wiki/Pig_Head "Pig Head"), [Wildbore](/wiki/Wildbore_Head "Wildbore Head") and [Merm](/wiki/Merm_Head "Merm Head") Heads glow white, generate an insanity aura, and drop Nightmare Fuel when hammered. [Ghosts](/wiki/Ghost "Ghost") will emerge from any type of [Grave](/wiki/Grave "Grave"), including [Watery Graves](/wiki/Watery_Grave "Watery Grave").

Full moons can also affect the Cave worlds. Unlike in the surface, the full moon does not provide light visibility to this world since caves are underground. Therefore, characters are required to have a sufficient light source while spelunking. Just like on the surface, the screen tone will change into a bluish color much like in [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"). Mushrooms also have a chance of turning into Mushtrees, Pigs will turn into Werepigs, and Flowers will change into Evil Flowers when in a cave.

In [RoG](/wiki/RoG "RoG"), [Glommer's Statue](/wiki/Glommer%27s_Statue "Glommer's Statue") grows [Glommer's Flower](/wiki/Glommer%27s_Flower "Glommer's Flower"), which causes a [Glommer](/wiki/Glommer "Glommer") to spawn nearby.

In [SW](/wiki/SW "SW"), [Tides](/wiki/Tides "Tides") in [Beach](/wiki/Beach "Beach") biomes are much stronger during a full moon and absent during a new moon. During a full moon, [Wildbores](/wiki/Wildbore "Wildbore") turn into [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig"), and [Big Waves](/wiki/Waves "Waves") become much more common.

In [HAM](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet"), during a full moon, [Pikos](/wiki/Piko "Piko") and [Orange Pikos](/wiki/Orange_Piko "Orange Piko") will become hostile to the Player, as well as give off a small amount of light if kept in the Player's [Inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory"). Similar to Woodie, the full moon forces [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba") to transform into her Werepig form. During the [Aporkalypse](/wiki/Aporkalypse "Aporkalypse"), the moon icon that shows the player the phase of the moon will be constant, showing a reddish moon, and the changes of a full moon will also be present.

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, a full moon only lasts one day. The first full moon occurs on day 11, and then it occurs every 20 days - on days 31, 51, 71, etc. Likewise, the first new moon occurs on day 1, and then it occurs every 20 days - on days 21, 41, 61, etc.

If players assemble all three [Lunar Altars](/wiki/Lunar_Altars "Lunar Altars") and the [Mysterious Energy](/wiki/Mysterious_Energy "Mysterious Energy") spawned successfully, the moon phase will be set to full moon, and the current day will turn into a full moon night until next day. The moon phase will remain as full moon until the [Celestial Champion](/wiki/Celestial_Champion "Celestial Champion") is defeated. Once the [Celestial Champion](/wiki/Celestial_Champion "Celestial Champion") is dead, the moon phase will become new moon, and current day will turn into a new moon night until next day. This will reset the moon cycle, although the period still being 20 days, but new moon and full moon may occur on a different day than previous. [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom")'s [Lunar Grimoire](/wiki/Lunar_Grimoire "Lunar Grimoire") will also change the moon phase to full moon, altering the moon cycle.

Mushrooms and flowers do not transform in the full moon.

Woodie has two additional possible transformations during the full moon: Weregoose and Weremoose. Unlike the full moon of the DLCs, Mushrooms and Flowers will not change.

The new moon phase has new effects. Hammering down [Chess Pieces](/wiki/Chess_Pieces "Chess Pieces") or mining repaired [Marble Sculptures](/wiki/Marble_Sculptures "Marble Sculptures") during new moon will summon [Shadow Pieces](/wiki/Shadow_Pieces "Shadow Pieces").

The moon cycle does not affect the caves and is not present in the caves in most cases, the [Vitreoasis](/wiki/Vitreoasis "Vitreoasis") in the [Lunar Grotto](/wiki/Lunar_Grotto "Lunar Grotto") is one exception though, as mined Vitreoasis have chance to regrow at each full moon.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* By [default](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode"), it takes 560 days for the beginning of the Moon Cycle to re-align with the first day of the starting season.
* When both seasons are set to "Long", 12 complete moon cycles will occur in 4 seasons' time (similar to a standard calendar year).
* With RoG, if a full moon occurs in the fifth [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") chapter "Darkness", everything happens as per normal (blue tint, Evil Flowers, etc.). However, it remains completely dark and a [light source](/wiki/Light "Light") is still required.
* Since the *[Return of Them](/wiki/Return_of_Them "Return of Them")* update in *Don't Starve Together*, the moon has a crack in it.
* Since any light is always on the left side of the moon (instead of switching sides as it does for the actual moon), it isn't possible to tell if it's waxing or waning from the icon alone
* The moon seems to be turning, as the crack on the moon moves every moon phase.
