The Reed Tunic is an item added to The Forge in Don't Starve Together. Available immediately from Maxwell and Wickerbottom.

It is armor for the body cell. Blocks damage by 50%. Reduces the cooldown speed of all abilities by 5%.

## Prototype Tips[]

* This armor is the worst in terms of damage absorption. Armor wearers should not go into melee combat, and melee characters (Wolfgang, WX-78) should not equip armor in favor of better damage protection.
* The 5% ability cooldown speed can slightly help Wickerbottom and Maxwell turn enemies to stone or plant lifeblooms more often until Wood Armor with Silk drops. Other characters can pick it up to flurry more often, at the expense of mobility.
