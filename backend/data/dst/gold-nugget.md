A **Gold Nugget** is a [mineral](/wiki/Category:Minerals "Category:Minerals") in *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")*. It is a required item for many [Crafting](/wiki/Crafting "Crafting") recipes

Gold Nuggets can be found by mining [Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder") (with gold veins on their side) or [Stalagmites](/wiki/Stalagmite "Stalagmite") (found only in [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves")). They can be found lying on the ground in [Graveyards](/wiki/Graveyard "Graveyard") or [Rocky](/wiki/Rockyland "Rockyland") [biomes](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes"), and fall from the ceiling in [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") during [Earthquakes](/wiki/Earthquake "Earthquake"). The [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King") will also exchange Gold Nuggets for certain items. As some of the aforementioned items exchangeable for Gold Nuggets are renewable, this makes it a fully renewable resource.

Like most other minerals, Gold Nuggets can be eaten by [Slurtles](/wiki/Slurtle "Slurtle") and [Snurtles](/wiki/Snurtle "Snurtle"), and Slurtles will attack a player carrying it if there aren't any other minerals in the immediate area.

## Downloadable Content[]

In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC, Gold Nuggets can be [Refined](/wiki/Refine "Refine") from [Dubloons](/wiki/Dubloons "Dubloons"). [Digging](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel") gold flecked [Magma Piles](/wiki/Magma_Pile "Magma Pile") can yield Gold Nuggets. Unlike gold veined Boulders, gold flecked Magma Piles do not have a preset amount of Gold Nuggets to drop. Instead, there is an independent 25% chance for each dug up item to be a Gold Nugget. Therefore, there is a small (~7.5%) chance to get no Gold Nuggets, and a *very* small (~0.00038%) chance to get a total 9 of them from each Magma Pile. Very rarely, Gold Nuggets can be found laying around in [Jungle](/wiki/Jungle "Jungle") and [Magma Field](/wiki/Magma_Field "Magma Field") biomes.

This DLC also introduces many new methods to obtain items, most of them include Gold Nuggets as a possible reward, however, typically chance of getting a Gold Nugget among all possible rewards is small and some of these are chance encounters, therefore these cannot be used as a reliable method to obtain Gold Nuggets. These methods include:

* Using [Trawl Net](/wiki/Trawl_Net "Trawl Net") outside of shallow [Ocean](/wiki/Ocean "Ocean").
* Gambling on the [Slot Machine](/wiki/Slot_Machine "Slot Machine").
* Digging up [X Marks the Spot](/wiki/X_Marks_the_Spot "X Marks the Spot") treasure chests.
* One preset of [Steamer Trunk](/wiki/Steamer_Trunk "Steamer Trunk").

In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC, [Gold Veins](/wiki/Gold_Vein "Gold Vein") are not present, so the task to obtain Gold has become more difficult. It is still possible to mine Gold from [Stalagmites](/wiki/Stalagmites "Stalagmites"), but Stalagmites themselves are rarer, and can only be found in [Cave Clefts](/wiki/Cave_Cleft "Cave Cleft"). However, new methods has been introduced to obtain gold:

* Pig Statues can be chiseled with a [Ball Pein Hammer](/wiki/Ball_Pein_Hammer "Ball Pein Hammer") to obtain 2 Gold Nuggets.
* 6 [Gold Dust](/wiki/Gold_Dust "Gold Dust") can be refined to obtain one Gold Nugget (however, 3 can be dropped near a [Pangolden](/wiki/Pangolden "Pangolden") for it to convert into 1 Gold Nugget).
* If a [Secret Bandit Camp](/wiki/Secret_Bandit_Camp "Secret Bandit Camp") treasure chest is open, there is a 1/6 chance to obtain 4 Gold Nuggets.
* Mining [Stalacmite Throne](/wiki/Stalacmite_Throne "Stalacmite Throne") dropped by [Queen Womant](/wiki/Queen_Womant "Queen Womant") have a chance to drop Gold Nuggets.
* Gold Nuggets can be bought for 10 [Oincs](/wiki/Oinc "Oinc") at the [Swinesbury Mineral Exchange](/wiki/Pig_Shops#Swinesbury_Mineral_Exchange "Pig Shops").
* [Trawling](/wiki/Trawl_Net "Trawl Net") in the Hamlet [Lilly Ponds](/wiki/Lily_Pond "Lily Pond") has 1.96% chance of getting 1 gold nugget.
* Smashing the '[A Smashing Pot](/wiki/A_Smashing_Pot "A Smashing Pot")' has 2% chance of getting 1 gold nugget.

## Don't Starve Together Don't Starve Together[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") can craft a Gold Nugget with 3 [Nitre](/wiki/Nitre "Nitre") if he had learned the [Transmute Ore II](/wiki/Transmute_Ore_II "Transmute Ore II") skill.
