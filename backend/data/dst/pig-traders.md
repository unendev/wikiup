*Exclusive to:* Hamlet

**“**I like pigs when they don't try to attack us.**”**

–[Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber")

**Pig Traders** are [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") exclusive to the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC. Various Pig Traders (besides the [Mayor](/wiki/Mayor_Truffleston "Mayor Truffleston") and [Pig Queen](/wiki/Pig_Queen "Pig Queen")) can be found wandering the [Pig City](/wiki/Pig_City "Pig City") during the [Day](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle") and will retreat to their homes as soon as it is Dusk. Compared to normal [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig"), Pig Traders are taller, completely passive, elaborately dressed, have noticeable genders depending on their professions and will not turn into [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig") during a full moon. Trading [Items](/wiki/Items "Items") with these Mobs is the player's primary source of [Oincs](/wiki/Oinc "Oinc").

One Pig Trader will spawn from each Town house, being of any type except for Mayor Truffleston, Pig Queen, Farmer, and Miner. These Pig Traders will wander randomly around their house and eat any edible items left on the ground, including [Pig Skin](/wiki/Pig_Skin "Pig Skin"). Every so often they will drop one Manure where they are standing, and if the player picks up that Manure the Pig Trader will approach them and give them one Oinc.

One Pig Trader will also be found in each of the game's [shops](/wiki/Pig_Shops "Pig Shops"). These Traders never leave their shops and will barter with the player until Night, when they reject trades and shops close. During the [Aporkalypse](/wiki/Seasons/Aporkalypse "Seasons/Aporkalypse"), all Pig Traders will remain in their homes and all shops will be closed.

Attacking a Pig Trader will cause [Royal Guards](/wiki/Royal_Guard "Royal Guard") near the outside of the building to become hostile to the player, and the attacked Trader will flee. In addition, two Royal Guards will enter the building who are hostile to the player. Killing a Pig Trader inside their shop will add 6 points to the player's [Naughtiness](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") level.

## Post Card of the Royal Palace Souvenir Gifting[]

In the Palace City, the player can find several souvenirs inside the leftmost room of the [Palace](/wiki/Palace "Palace"). If the player gives any of the souvenirs (either [Post Card of the Royal Palace](/wiki/Trinkets#Hamlet "Trinkets") or the [Queen Malfalfa](/wiki/Trinkets#Hamlet "Trinkets") statue) to any Pig Traders outside of Palace City such as those in Swinesbury City (the city with the City Hall building) or those from player-created Town Houses, they will reward the player with one of the following items:

Kabobs Pumpkin Cookie Taffy Oinc Butter Muffin Powdercake

Each Pig Trader can only be gifted once. Afterwards, they will reject all souvenirs.

## Centapiece Oinc Economy[]

Each Pig Trader has specific items they desire and will reward Oincs for such items. Attempting to trade an undesired item will result in rejection. Additionally, if the player is [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba"), Traders in the streets will occasionally gift basic resources such as [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs").

The table below lists all Pig Traders, their desired items, Oincs rewarded upon satisfactory trades, daily trading limits, and the Trader's locations:

## PrototypeTips[]

* Like Royal Guards, Pig Traders found on the streets will warn of the oncoming Aporkalypse if it is near.
* After picking up the manure Pig Traders drop, it is possible to lure them away from Royal Guards for an easy kill, since they will follow the player even outside the Pig City to give them an Oinc.
* Stingers can be traded to the Collector for 3 Oincs or the Hunter for 5 Oincs, and Silk can be traded to the Collector for 3 Oincs or the Hatmaker for 5 Oincs. However, both the Hunter and the Hatmaker only trade once per day, while the Collector can be traded with without limit.

## Mosquito Bugs[]

* Upon buying a shop item, Pig Trader may continuously run against its own desk, not being able to go around it to restock the item. User has to exit and re-enter the building in order to get Pig Trader restock the item.
* When using the One Man Band, a pig trader can become a follower... then when you exit the shop and re-enter it, the pig trader will block the door, making you trapped in the building
