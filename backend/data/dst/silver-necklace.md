**“**PAPA GIVETH WILBA THIS FOR THE HAIRY TIMES**”**

–[Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba")

The **Silver Necklace** is a wearable [Item](/wiki/Item "Item") exclusive to [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba") in the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC. If Wilba is wearing it during a [Full Moon](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle"), during the [Aporkalypse](/wiki/Aporkalypse "Aporkalypse"), or after eating 2 monster foods, she will not transform into her [Werepig](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba") form.

The necklace will start draining -6.66 [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") per minute during the period where she would typically undergo her transformation. If Wilba unequips the necklace during this time, she will turn into Werewilba, unless the Full Moon or Aporkalypse has already ended.

## Prototype Tips[]

* The sanity drain from Silver Necklace and the sanity drain at Dusk and Night can stack to 11.66 (actually is about 14.66 as Wilba drains sanity 50% faster) points per minute.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The Werepig-forestalling properties of the silver necklace may be based on how werewolves are believed to be vulnerable to silver objects.
* The necklace appears to be in the shape of an artichoke.
