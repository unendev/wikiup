*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 See also: [Pew-matic Horn](/wiki/Pew-matic_Horn "Pew-matic Horn") and [Navigadget](/wiki/Navigadget "Navigadget")*

She starts with the [Pew-matic Horn](/wiki/Pew-matic_Horn "Pew-matic Horn"), which is able to shoot certain items to damage mobs, and the [Navigadget](/wiki/Navigadget "Navigadget"), which is able to direct the player to the nearest chosen item by placing the desired item into it. For example, if [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs") were placed within, it will guide the player to the nearest pickable [Sapling](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling").

Wheeler's base movement [speed](/wiki/Speed "Speed") is 5% higher compared to other characters, and increases by 1% for every empty inventory slot. Items inside of backpacks are ignored, allowing her to move faster as long as all of her items are in a backpack and not in her main inventory. Slots added by a backpack do not count towards increasing her speed when empty.

She is also able to perform an action called "Dodge", which allows her to move swiftly over a short distance. The ability needs to recharge (1.5 seconds) [[1]](#cite_note-1) before the player is able to do it again. During the dodge animation Wheeler is completely invulnerable from all forms of physical damage, although any [armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor") equipped will still be affected.

## Disadvantages[]

Whereas the other characters have 15 inventory slots with additional hand, body and head slots (18 total), Wheeler only has 12 slots to go with the three equipment slots (15 total). It should be noted that both of her exclusive items have one additional slot (17 total), allowing players to use them as additional storage, although the [Navigadget](/wiki/Navigadget "Navigadget") can only carry one item.

She has lower maximum health, 100 Health, which is lower compared to the majority of characters.

## Prototype Tips[]

* Correct use of Dodge ability can enable Wheeler to be extremely proficient in close-quarters combat.
* Wheeler's Dodge ability and fast movement allows her to explore more efficiently.
* Wheeler's Dodge ability is very useful in fighting [Spider Warriors](/wiki/Spider_Warrior "Spider Warrior") and [Boss Monsters](/wiki/Boss_Monster "Boss Monster"). Her ability can also easily avoid the mucus spit from [Ewecus](/wiki/Ewecus "Ewecus") and [Dragoon Eggs](/wiki/Dragoon_Egg "Dragoon Egg") in [Dry Season](/wiki/Dry_Season "Dry Season").
* Wheeler's speed movement can stack with the [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane") or [Stalking Stick](/wiki/Stalking_Stick "Stalking Stick"), [Magiluminescence](/wiki/Magiluminescence "Magiluminescence"), and the [Sleek Hat](/wiki/Sleek_Hat "Sleek Hat") to have a total increase of **up to** 67% movement speed while both items are worn, which means that while on a [road](/wiki/Road "Road"), the player will have **up to** 97% speed boost. This can further be increased by eating [Coffee](/wiki/Coffee "Coffee"), [Tropical Bouillabaisse](/wiki/Tropical_Bouillabaisse "Tropical Bouillabaisse"), [Iced Tea](/wiki/Iced_Tea "Iced Tea") and/or [Tea](/wiki/Tea "Tea").
* As a ranged weapon, Pew-matic Horn can be used to easily kill mobs that run away from the player, [kite](/wiki/Kite "Kite") the player or cannot move. Those include [Birds](/wiki/Bird "Bird"), [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit"), [Koalefants](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant"), [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus"), [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs"), [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm"), [Eyeplants](/wiki/Eyeplant "Eyeplant"), [MacTusks](/wiki/MacTusk "MacTusk"), [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle"), [Big Tentacles](/wiki/Big_Tentacle "Big Tentacle"), [Moslings](/wiki/Mosling "Mosling") Reign of Giants icon, [Crabbits](/wiki/Crabbit "Crabbit") Shipwrecked icon, [Dogfishes](/wiki/Dogfish "Dogfish") Shipwrecked icon, [Dragoons](/wiki/Dragoon "Dragoon") Shipwrecked icon, [Fishermerms](/wiki/Fishermerm "Fishermerm") Shipwrecked icon, [Floaty Boaty Knights](/wiki/Floaty_Boaty_Knight "Floaty Boaty Knight") Shipwrecked icon, [Wildbores](/wiki/Wildbore "Wildbore") Shipwrecked icon, [Hanging Vines](/wiki/Hanging_Vine "Hanging Vine"), [Royal Guards](/wiki/Royal_Guard "Royal Guard"), [Pikos](/wiki/Piko "Piko"), [Snaptooth Flytraps](/wiki/Snaptooth_Flytrap "Snaptooth Flytrap"), [Thunderbirds](/wiki/Thunderbird "Thunderbird") and [Peagawk](/wiki/Peagawk "Peagawk")s.
* Attacking [Elephant Cactus](/wiki/Elephant_Cactus "Elephant Cactus"), [Brambles](/wiki/Bramble "Bramble"), [Bramble Blooms](/wiki/Bramble_Bloom "Bramble Bloom") and [Jellyfishes](/wiki/Jellyfish "Jellyfish") with the Pew-matic Horn won't damage the player, as it is a ranged weapon.
* In the base game, *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* or *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* worlds, putting [Boards](/wiki/Boards "Boards") inside the Navigadget allows the player to easily find the [Wicker Basket](/wiki/Wicker_Basket "Wicker Basket"), which can be [hammered](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer") for a [Can of Silly String](/wiki/Can_of_Silly_String "Can of Silly String") to craft the [Skyworthy](/wiki/Skyworthy "Skyworthy") to travel other worlds.
* In the base game or *Reign of Giants* worlds, one can use the [Thulecite](/wiki/Thulecite "Thulecite") dropped by the [Sinkhole](/wiki/Sinkhole "Sinkhole") in the Navigadget to find [Ancient Statues](/wiki/Ancient_Statue "Ancient Statue") to get more [Thulecite](/wiki/Thulecite "Thulecite").
* In the base game or *Reign of Giants* worlds, [meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") can be put into Navigadget to find the [Ancient Guardian](/wiki/Ancient_Guardian "Ancient Guardian") in the [Labyrinth](/wiki/Labyrinth "Labyrinth").
* In *Shipwrecked* worlds, putting a [Doydoy](/wiki/Doydoy "Doydoy") inside the Navigadget allows the player to easily find the other one.
* In *Shipwrecked* worlds, the [Slot Machine](/wiki/Slot_Machine "Slot Machine") can be found by putting a [Dubloon](/wiki/Dubloon "Dubloon") inside Navigadget, as the Slot Machine spawns surrounded by three Dubloons.
* As [Gold](/wiki/Gold "Gold") is rare in *Hamlet*, one can find more Gold by putting Gold inside Navigadget.
* [Bramble Blooms](/wiki/Bramble_Bloom "Bramble Bloom") can be found by putting a [Bramble Bulb](/wiki/Bramble_Bulb "Bramble Bulb") into the Navigadget.
* She can actually loses less [hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") per minute if the player constantly makes use of Dodge since she is immune to hunger effects during Dodge frames.
* With proper timing she can actually Dodge Charlie's attacks while in complete darkness.
