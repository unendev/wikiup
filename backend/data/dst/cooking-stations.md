In [The Gorge](/wiki/The_Gorge "The Gorge") event, players need to cook to earn Maw's favor. However, it's not as easy as in a regular game (throw random ingredients into a cauldron and wait until the dish cooks itself). Initially, you need to buy kitchen sets from Mamzi, which contain various cooking stations.

Cookpot Kit

**Pot Hanger** is a station dropped by the [Cookpot Kit](/wiki/Kitchen_sets "Kitchen sets"). Dropped as an item, once planted over a fire pit, works as a structure. You can hang a cauldron, a large cauldron or a syrup cauldron on it. If Wilson is standing next to the hanger where something is being cooked, the cooking efficiency improves.

The **Oven** is a station that drops from the [Oven Kit](/wiki/Kitchen_sets "Kitchen sets"). Dropped as an item, once planted over a fire pit, works as a structure. You can put a small or large brazier in it. If Wolfgang is standing next to the oven in which something is being cooked, the cooking efficiency improves.

### Dropped by

Small Grill Kit

**Small Grill** is a station that drops from the [Grill Kit](/wiki/Kitchen_sets "Kitchen sets"). Dropped as an item, once planted over a fire pit, works as a structure. Unlike a boiler and stove hanger, it does not require any additional containers for cooking, the grill itself is a container: to start cooking, you need to put the ingredients into the grill and make a fire.

The grill is for frying. Various burgers, steaks, etc. are cooked on the grill. The small grill has 3 slots for ingredients. If Wendy is standing next to the grill where something is being cooked, the cooking efficiency improves.

If something is on the grill while the fire is burning, the ingredients inside it will slowly fry. The cooking time depends on the intensity of the fire in the fire pit and whether Wendy is standing next to the grill. If the ingredients inside the grill match one of the recipes, steam will come out of the grill, signaling that the dish is ready. However, if you overcook the finished dish on the fire, smoke starts to come out of the grill, and instead of a good dish, you get a burnt dish. Also, a burnt dish is obtained if the fried ingredients inside the grill do not fit any of the recipes.

Large Grill Kit

The Large Grill is an improved version of the Small Grill: it has 4 cells instead of 3, which allows you to cook more complex dishes. Wendy also increases the cooking efficiency of the large grill by standing next to it. Unlike other large containers (large cauldron, large brazier), a large grill can only be obtained through trade with Pipton, in a large grill kit.

Otherwise, the characteristics of the large grill are similar to those of the small grill.
