**“**For getting dolled up.**”**

–[Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona")

The **Curio Cabinet** is an [Interface](/wiki/Category:Interface "Category:Interface") feature exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. It allows the player to view Curios they have collected in their inventory. There are seven different types of Curios: [Skins](/wiki/Skins "Skins"), [Belongings](/wiki/Belongings "Belongings"), [Emotes](/wiki/Emotes "Emotes"), [Emoticons](/wiki/Emoticons "Emoticons"), [Portrait Frames](/wiki/Portrait_Frames "Portrait Frames"), [Profile Icons](/wiki/Profile_Icons "Profile Icons"), [Beards](/wiki/Beards "Beards"), and [Vignettes](/wiki/Vignettes "Vignettes").

The Gift Box.

 

All Curios except Vignettes, Portrait Frames and Profile Icons are collected at random times while playing on a *Don't Starve Together* server, and the timing is weighted so that users who play an average amount in a week should get a few gifts, and those who play a decent amount should get the full maximum.[[1]](#cite_note-1) Players can get a maximum of 15 Curios from randomly timed drops per week; this count resets every Thursday around 1pm PST, before [Klei's weekly Twitch broadcast](https://www.twitch.tv/kleientertainment). The arrival of a randomly timed drop will be signaled by a gift box appearing in the top-left corner of the screen and a sound similar to ripping paper. After this, the player must go to a [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") or [Alchemy Engine](/wiki/Alchemy_Engine "Alchemy Engine") to open the gift. When a whistle plays and the research station starts producing streams of shadows, it can be opened and the Curio will be obtained. The player has to be active in order to receive Curios, and must open the earlier gift box to receive the next one.

Players will additionally receive a daily gift by logging into the game. These gifts arrive upon entering the main menu of the game. Together with the 8 randomly timed drops ingame, this allows for a maximum of 15 Curios to obtain per week.[[2]](#cite_note-2) Some Curios are obtainable during the official duration of an ingame [Event](/wiki/Category:Events "Category:Events").

Curios are classified into different tiers of rarity. Items of **Common**, **Classy**, **Spiffy**, **Distinguished**, or **Elegant** rarity are always tradable and marketable, unless marked with an **Event** or **Seasonal** modifier. The drop rates are depending on the Curios' rarity, higher tier Curios have a lower chance of dropping ingame:

* **Common:** 52.7%
* **Classy:** 26.0%
* **Spiffy:** 13.0%
* **Distinguished:** 6.0%
* **Elegant:** 2.3%

Items of **Loyal**, **Timeless**, **Event**, **Proof of Purchase**, **Reward**, or **Heirloom** rarity are unobtainable from the weekly random drops and are instead obtained through other means. None of these except **Heirloom** are tradable or marketable.

Players using [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) are able to trade Curios with other players or to buy and sell them on the Community Market. Regular Skins and Belongings can be used in the [Trade Inn](/wiki/Trade_Inn "Trade Inn") interface, where a player can exchange nine unwanted Skins for a Skin of higher rarity. Unwanted Curios, except for those of **Loyal**, **Timeless**, **Event**, or **Reward** rarity can additionally be unraveled into [Spools](/wiki/Spools "Spools"), which can then be woven into items with an **Event**, **Seasonal** or **Classic** modifier. Curios received from gifts give an average of 32.385 Spools when unraveled. For example, buying one of the 4 main purchasable characters ([Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox"), [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt"), [Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda") and [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood")) costs 2,700 Spools, which (on average) would take about 83 gifts, which in turn would take just over 5 and a half weeks while getting the maximum amount of gifts mentioned above (15 gifts / week). Alternatively, players can purchase Event-applicable and [Character](/wiki/Characters "Characters")-themed [Treasure Chests](/wiki/Treasury "Treasury") from [Klei Entertainment](/wiki/Klei_Entertainment "Klei Entertainment") directly through Steam.

Nome's Potato Cup.

 

* The Curio drop system was overhauled alongside the release of the [Winona Character Update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History#March_7th,_2019_-_Winona_Character_Update "Don't Starve Together/Version History"). Previously, players could only receive a maximum of 4 randomly timed drops per week and daily bonuses were not present. Before the update, drop rates per rarity were determined as followed:
  + **Common:** 68%
  + **Classy:** 23.00%
  + **Spiffy:** 6.00%
  + **Distinguished:** 2.50%
  + **Elegant:** 0.50%
* The Curio Cabinet was implemented together with *[The Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge")* event, replacing the Collection feature that served a similar function before.
* There is a placeholder item called the Thingamabob, which has the description, "*This item completely mystifies you.*"
* In one of the developers' inventory, Nome, there is a **Timeless** Potato Cup skin. It was used by the developers to test skins. Its description is: "*Something to do with all those useless potatoes you have lying around. Stop looking like a chump drinking your water out of glasses or beefalo horns.*"
