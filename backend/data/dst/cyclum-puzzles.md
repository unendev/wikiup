## Cyclum

MaxAndWilson

**“**Spooky.**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

The **Cyclum Puzzles** are a set of comic panels that explain the gap between the events of [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell")'s freedom and the events of *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. Starting from April 21, 2016 until the 29th, the [Cyclum web page](http://cyclum.dontstarvetogether.com/) would update daily revealing a new piece of the comic and puzzle. In some cases the page may also require participation from the page visitor to advance further.

Reaching the last step of the puzzle would reward players with the Tragic Torch cosmetic [Skin](/wiki/Belongings "Belongings") for use in Don't Starve Together. For the purposes of saving a participant's progress and rewarding them with the torch, it is required for the user to log into [Steam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(software)) to advance the puzzle.

On 4/10/2017, the Cyclum puzzle was reopened for completion to all players. Upon completion, players were gifted the Tragic Torch skin in game.

Tragic Torches received before reopening received a quality update to Timeless.

Once players complete the Cyclum Puzzles and receive the in-game gift item, the [Tragic Torch](/wiki/Belongings#Torch "Belongings"), players can proceed on to the [Metheus Puzzles](/wiki/Metheus_Puzzles "Metheus Puzzles").

## The Story[]

The story was split into 4 pages plus a secret video. It starts with Maxwell falling out of a portal and being dropped into his own world. After recovering from his fall, a [Spider](/wiki/Spider "Spider") approaches him with aggressive intent. Maxwell raises his hand to attack the spider using shadow magic, but nothing happens. Realizing he lost his powers after being freed, Maxwell flees from the pack of [Hounds](/wiki/Hounds "Hounds") and spiders.

After escaping, Maxwell experiences the effects of [Insanity](/wiki/Insanity "Insanity") and is surrounded by [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures"), to which he then puts a [Garland](/wiki/Garland "Garland") on his head to drive them away. As nightfall approaches, Maxwell notices a bright light and smoke in the distance. He begins to walk towards it to escape the dangers of darkness. As he approaches it, Maxwell discovers Wilson eating a carrot he just finished roasting in a fire pit. Curious, Maxwell watches Wilson in secret while hiding behind a berry bush. Suddenly, Wilson is startled by the sound of Maxwell stepping on a stick. He grabs his axe and goes to investigate.

When Wilson realizes it was Maxwell sneaking into his camp, he drops his axe and rolls up his sleeves to personally confront Maxwell with his fists. While Wilson was distracted by his fight with Maxwell, a night hand appears and extinguishes the fire protecting them both from the darkness. After seeing this, they both set aside their differences and rush to re-fuel the fire pit just in time to escape the impending darkness. When they recovered, the two look at each other realizing they're both in the same position and must deal with each other to survive.

Wilson and Maxwell survive together for several days, seemingly doing nothing other than staring at each other near their fire pit. Eventually, Wilson notices Maxwell grabbing his stomach out of starvation. So, he cooks up a [Kabob](/wiki/Kabobs "Kabobs") and offers it to Maxwell, much to his surprise.

That night, Wilson and Maxwell begin to talk to each other about the current situation. Wilson asks Maxwell how he is still alive after witnessing him turn into a skeleton and fade away after being freed from the [Nightmare Throne](/wiki/Nightmare_Throne "Nightmare Throne"). Shrugging the question off, Maxwell then asks Wilson why he isn't trapped on the Nightmare Throne. Maxwell glares at Wilson for an explanation, to which Wilson then tells his story.

 File:Don%27t Starve Together - A New Reign Cinematic-0 

Don't Starve Together - A New Reign Cinematic-0

The "*A New Reign"* cinematic video depicting Wilson being freed by Charlie.

 

After Wilson explained how he was sent back to the islands after being freed by [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie"), Maxwell searches through Wilson's chest the following morning and finds a blueprint, to which Wilson snatches away from him. Maxwell then pulls out the [Codex Umbra](/wiki/Codex_Umbra "Codex Umbra"), showing his own blueprints within the book.

Wilson and Maxwell spend the next day working together to build the contraption, the final product of which is the [Jury-Rigged Portal](/wiki/Jury-Rigged_Portal "Jury-Rigged Portal"). After a familiar situation where Maxwell tells Wilson to pull the lever on the portal, it activates and becomes operational. As [Wendy](/wiki/Wendy "Wendy"), [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang"), and [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes") emerge from the portal, rose bushes suddenly erupt from the ground, tearing down the portal while replacing it with the [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern"). A faint image of Charlie is seen in the sky by everyone.
