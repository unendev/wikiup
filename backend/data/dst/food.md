**“**What deliciousness shall you yield?**”**

–[Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly")

**Food** can be obtained by foraging, [trapping](/wiki/Trap "Trap"), [farming](/wiki/Farming "Farming") or hunting mobs. Food refills [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") and may restore some [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") along with [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"), depending on the quality of the food eaten. Eating some foods, such as [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") or [Durians](/wiki/Durian "Durian"), can damage the player's health instead of restoring it. Some foods, such as raw [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") or [Morsels](/wiki/Morsel "Morsel"), will damage a player's sanity if eaten. [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms") have varying effects on Health and Sanity depending on their color. Some special food items, such as [Glow Berry](/wiki/Glow_Berry "Glow Berry"), have additional effects when eaten.

Almost all raw food can be [Cooked](/wiki/Cooking "Cooking") on a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") to increase the amount of Health/Hunger/Sanity restored or reduced, and sometimes remove Health/Sanity penalties from eating it. Some raw food items, most notably [Meats](/wiki/Meats "Meats"), can be dried on a [Drying Rack](/wiki/Drying_Rack "Drying Rack") to produce long lasting food items with increased Health/Hunger/Sanity values. Additionally, a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") can be used for making foods that have additional benefits.

Food items also have other uses than eating them directly. [Meat](/wiki/Meats "Meats") can be used as bait for carnivores, for the recruitment of [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig"), and as an offering to the [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King") for [Gold Nuggets](/wiki/Gold_Nugget "Gold Nugget"). A renewable way to gain [Eggs](/wiki/Egg "Egg") is by giving meats to [birds](/wiki/Birds "Birds") housed in [Bird Cages](/wiki/Bird_Cage "Bird Cage"). Meat is also a requirement to construct the [Meat Effigy](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy"). [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnymen "Bunnymen") can be befriended using [Carrots](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot") and will become hostile if meat is in the player's inventory. [Vegetables](/wiki/Vegetable "Vegetable") and [Fruits](/wiki/Fruit "Fruit") can be used as bait for herbivores and given to Pigs to obtain [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure"). [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") can be used to bait [Bird Traps](/wiki/Bird_Trap "Bird Trap").

Being of the most important items in the game, (and part of the game's namesake, to not starve) food is typically very valuable in any world; however, given the layouts of different maps and what spawns in them, food availability can vary from being abundant, to dangerously short. Food is affected by the [seasons](/wiki/Seasons "Seasons"), which likely encourages the player to take advantages of seasonal diets and also take advantages of the food's shelf life.

With the introduction of [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") mechanic in the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC (and carried over to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* and the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC), some foods are classified as hot or cold, providing an alternative way to combat [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") and [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating"), respectively.

When players eat Foods that count as Meats, they will have a chewing animation and are not able to perform other actions for a relatively long duration. When eating Foods that are not Meats, they will just put it into their mouth very fast.

## Perish Times[]

Most food and some non-edible items have a perish time, eventually turning into [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot"), turning into another food or item, or disappearing completely.

| **Stage** | **Effect** |
| --- | --- |
| **Green (50-100% Fresh)** | Restores the full amount of Hunger, Health and Sanity for a given food. |
| **Yellow (21-49% Stale)** | Restores 2/3 of Hunger, 1/3 of Health for a given food and doesn't restore any Sanity. |
| **Red (0-20% Spoiled)** | Restores 1/2 of Hunger for a given food, doesn't restore any Health and decreases Sanity by 10. |

In addition to above modifiers, the same items can be affected by some other modifiers if any of the condition below is true:

| Condition | Spoilage Rate (higher = spoils faster) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When in inventory | 0.25 Moon Moth Don't Starve Together icon 0.0125 (Blue Spore/Red Spore/Green Spore) Don't Starve Together icon |  |
| World temperature below 0 Tallbird Egg Death Cold | 0.75 / 0 | Mostly in [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), 0 only applies to Ice/HailShipwrecked icon. |

| [Aporkalypse](/wiki/Aporkalypse "Aporkalypse") Hamlet icon | 1.5 |  |
| Melting near Heat Source Fire Pit | 30 | Only applies to Ice/HailShipwrecked icon. |

For example, according to tables above during winter, when temperature is below 0°, [Soggy](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") perishable items in the Ice Box or Snow Chester will spoil at **0.5 × 0.75 × 1.3 = 0.4875** rate.

* Any kind of cooked meat lasts longer than any raw meat, but any kind of raw vegetable lasts longer than any cooked vegetable. The exceptions are Popcorn, which lasts longer than raw Corn; [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms"), which last the same amount of time whether cooked or raw; and [Seaweed](/wiki/Seaweed "Seaweed") in *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* which lasts longer when cooked.
* [Cooking](/wiki/Cooking "Cooking") food on fire or in a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") halves the current spoilage of the food (e.g. if a food were at 80% freshness when raw (thus 20% spoiled), it would convert to 90% freshness after being cooked (10% spoiled)).
* Monster meat is the only meat in the game that lasts longer overall the earlier it is cooked (i.e. monster meat will last 15 days total if cooked at 100% freshness, but will last 14.25 days total (3 days raw + 11.25 days cooked) if cooked at 50% freshness)
* Being near the Spore Bomb of a [Toadstool](/wiki/Toadstool "Toadstool") will accelerate spoiling rapidly.
* Foods spoil 25% faster during the [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer").https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f8/Reign of Giants icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20140408110712
* The negative effects characters get from eating stale and spoiled food do not apply to [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78").
* The effects of eating stale or spoiled food are worse when playing as [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom"). Stale food will only give 1/3 of the hunger and 1/4 of health. Spoiled food will restore only 1/6 of the hunger. The rest of the values are the same as other characters.
* [Tallbird Eggs](/wiki/Tallbird_Egg "Tallbird Egg"), [Mandrakes](/wiki/Mandrake "Mandrake") (raw and cooked), the [Deerclops Eyeball](/wiki/Deerclops_Eyeball "Deerclops Eyeball"), [Guardian's Horn](/wiki/Guardian%27s_Horn "Guardian's Horn"), ([Glommer's Goop](/wiki/Glommer%27s_Goop "Glommer's Goop") https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f8/Reign of Giants icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20140408110712, [Jellybeans](/wiki/Jellybeans "Jellybeans") Don't Starve Together icon) and (["Ballphin Free" Tuna](/wiki/%22Ballphin_Free%22_Tuna "\"Ballphin Free\" Tuna") https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/46/Shipwrecked icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20151205104708, which gives one [Fish Steak](/wiki/Fish_Steak "Fish Steak") when used) are the only Food items which don't spoil (despite Honey being the only food in real life that does not spoil).
* Food cooked in the Crock Pot and meat dried on the [Drying Rack](/wiki/Drying_Rack "Drying Rack") do not begin to spoil until picked up. This was changed in the *Reign of Giants* DLC.
* Spoiled [Eggs](/wiki/Egg "Egg") become [Rotten Eggs](/wiki/Rotten_Egg "Rotten Egg") instead of Rot.
* Spoiled [Tea](/wiki/Tea "Tea") instead becomes [Iced Tea](/wiki/Iced_Tea "Iced Tea"), which can then turn into Rot.

## Food Temperature[]

A food with a defined temperature effect will increase/decrease the player's perceived temperature by 40°, for varying lengths of time. This effect is not directly related to, or affected by the food's freshness.

Cold foods preserve their full effect until they rot.

Hot foods, however, will cool off over time (shortening the duration of the increased temperature effect, rather than decreasing in temperature) after being made (all hot foods are [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") dishes). Hot foods will cool off four times as fast if put inside a functioning [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box"). This cool-off increase will also happen inside [Snow Chester](/wiki/Snow_Chester "Snow Chester"). The [Insulated Pack](/wiki/Insulated_Pack "Insulated Pack"), [Sea Sack](/wiki/Sea_Sack "Sea Sack"), [Chef Pouch](/wiki/Chef_Pouch "Chef Pouch") and the [Bundling Wrap](/wiki/Bundling_Wrap "Bundling Wrap") will preserve the temperature effect indefinitely.

Splitting a stack of hot food will reset the temperature duration of the new stack, and combining stacks will set the duration to the same as the stack that is being added to.

An exception to the cooling-down effect of hot foods are several non-perishable food items available during [Winter's Feast](/wiki/Winter%27s_Feast "Winter's Feast") in *Don't Starve Together*. These foods will keep a long-lasting hot effect indefinitely, making them a great item to keep around static resurrection structures, especially during Winter:

* [Hot Cocoa](/wiki/Winter%27s_Feast#Winter_Foods "Winter's Feast")
* [Apple Cider](/wiki/Winter%27s_Feast#Winter_Foods "Winter's Feast")

## Favorite Food Don't Starve Together[]

In *Don't Starve Together*, characters gain an extra 15 Hunger when eating food they consider their favorite. The extra value is affected by freshness.

## Prototype Tips[]

* [Meatballs](/wiki/Meatballs "Meatballs") should be prioritized for most [characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") excluding those unable to consume [meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") during the early game as a decent way of dealing with hunger before moving down the list with more elaborated food, such as [Honey Ham](/wiki/Honey_Ham "Honey Ham").
* In order to maximize the endurance of a food item, the player can cook it in a suitable time. Taking into account the difference of spoil rate of the cooked version and the raw version of a certain food can be useful to the player to know whether it's best to cook it or not.
* When cooking [sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") restoring food, one should be wary of their freshness, as when they turn stale, they no longer restore sanity. Since most sanity restoring food items require specific ingredients, it's recommended to consume them as soon as possible in order to benefit from the sanity gain without wasting expensive ingredients for small amounts of hunger and little to no health gains.
