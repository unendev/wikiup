Stone Splint Mail is an item added to The Forge in Don't Starve Together.

It is armor for the body cell. Blocks damage by 85%. It has no additional special effects.

## Prototype Tips[]

* This armor is in third place among all Crucible armor in terms of protection against damage, so players who take damage on themselves (tanks) are advised to change wood armor to chain mail as soon as possible.
