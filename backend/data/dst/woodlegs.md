–[Wheeler](/wiki/Wheeler "Wheeler"), when examining Woodlegs's Cage

Woodlegs is locked in a cage that is found in the [Volcano](/wiki/Volcano_(biome) "Volcano (biome)"). To unlock the cage, players must find three Keys:

* The [Iron Key](/wiki/Iron_Key "Iron Key") is dropped by the [Quacken](/wiki/Quacken "Quacken") only once.
* The [Golden Key](/wiki/Golden_Key "Golden Key") is received randomly from the [Yaarctopus](/wiki/Yaarctopus "Yaarctopus") upon trading.
* The [Bone Key](/wiki/Bone_Key "Bone Key") is available on chance by fishing up a [Watery Grave](/wiki/Watery_Grave "Watery Grave"). Each dug grave in the vicinity gives the player a higher chance of finding the key.

Each Key can be inserted in its hole even if players don't have all of them. After all the Keys are inserted, the cage will break down in smoke. Woodlegs will stand up and will do a jump while tapping his peg legs in the air (same animation as when you drink [Anti Venom](https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Anti_Venom)), then he will disappear in a puff of smoke. The broken cage will drop 2 [Boards](/wiki/Boards "Boards"), 2 [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log"), and 1 [Rock](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks").

## Placeholder Trivia[]

### In-Game[]

* Woodlegs was added to *Don't Starve: Shipwrecked* in the *[Release the Quacken](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked#February_25.2C_2016_-_Release_the_Quacken_Update "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* update on February 25, 2016.
  + Woodlegs was the first character to be revealed for *Shipwrecked*, but was the last to be added.
* Since Woodlegs is a pirate, he seems to speak [Pirate Lingo](https://www.piratevoyages.com/pirate-lingo); his old motto was "Yarrr".
* Woodlegs used to have an additional perk: When sinking, he would not drown, but would instead be spawned on the closest island and provided with materials needed to craft a [Log Raft](/wiki/Log_Raft "Log Raft"). However, this ability was removed in the *[Seas the Day](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked#March_23.2C_2016_-_Seas_the_Day_Update "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* update.
* Woodlegs' voice is played by a [concertina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concertina "wikipedia:concertina"), an instrument commonly associated with pirates.
* His peglegs give him unique sound effects when walking.
* He can "bend" his legs as if he had knees, though this may be unintentional, since the legs do not bend in the animated trailers.
* When struck by [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning"), it can be seen that Woodlegs has bones in his peg legs.
* He is one of six characters that can't be unlocked via experience, alongside [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes"), [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(character) "Maxwell (character)"), [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber"), [Wilbur](/wiki/Wilbur "Wilbur"), and [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba").
* When examined after freeing him, he has no defined name for this state, leaving the default phrase MISSINGNAME.
* An early iteration of Woodlegs would have made him able to transform into a skeleton, but the developers had trouble implementing the mechanic. Game files of this skeleton form became known as the [unimplemented character](/wiki/Unimplemented_Characters "Unimplemented Characters") Wilton.[[1]](#cite_note-1)

### Lore[]

* According to his examination quotes, Woodlegs had a crew including shipmates,[[2]](#cite_note-2) a cook,[[3]](#cite_note-3) and a first mate named Wildeye Weston.[[4]](#cite_note-4) He also once had a parrot.[[5]](#cite_note-5)
* He may have originated from the real world in the future compared to the other [Survivors](/wiki/Characters "Characters"), based on his examination quote for [Waffles](/wiki/Waffles "Waffles"), "Just like me mum opened from th'package."
* Woodlegs' tongue is made out of wood, considering his examination quote for [Spicy Chili](/wiki/Spicy_Chili "Spicy Chili").
