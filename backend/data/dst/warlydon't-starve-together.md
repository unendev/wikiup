Warly cooking all eleven of his unique dishes in Portable Crock Pots.

 

In DST, Warly starts with 2 [Potatoes](/wiki/Potato "Potato"), 1 [Garlic](/wiki/Garlic "Garlic"), and a [Portable Crock Pot](/wiki/Portable_Crock_Pot "Portable Crock Pot") in his inventory. He can craft the [Portable Crock Pot](/wiki/Portable_Crock_Pot "Portable Crock Pot") and two additional cookware: a [Portable Grinding Mill](/wiki/Portable_Grinding_Mill "Portable Grinding Mill") to make [seasoning powders](/wiki/Seasonings "Seasonings"), and a [Portable Seasoning Station](/wiki/Portable_Seasoning_Station "Portable Seasoning Station") to season any prepared foods. Warly is able to cook 11 exclusive recipes in his [Portable Crock Pot](/wiki/Portable_Crock_Pot "Portable Crock Pot"): [Asparagazpacho](/wiki/Asparagazpacho "Asparagazpacho"), [Bone Bouillon](/wiki/Bone_Bouillon "Bone Bouillon"), [Fish Cordon Bleu](/wiki/Fish_Cordon_Bleu "Fish Cordon Bleu"), [Fresh Fruit Crepes](/wiki/Fresh_Fruit_Crepes "Fresh Fruit Crepes"), [Glow Berry Mousse](/wiki/Glow_Berry_Mousse "Glow Berry Mousse"), [Grim Galette](/wiki/Grim_Galette "Grim Galette"), [Hot Dragon Chili Salad](/wiki/Hot_Dragon_Chili_Salad "Hot Dragon Chili Salad"), [Monster Tartare](/wiki/Monster_Tartare "Monster Tartare"), [Moqueca](/wiki/Moqueca "Moqueca"), [Puffed Potato Soufflé](/wiki/Puffed_Potato_Souffl%C3%A9 "Puffed Potato Soufflé"), and [Volt Goat Chaud-Froid](/wiki/Volt_Goat_Chaud-Froid "Volt Goat Chaud-Froid").

Warly is the only character who can use this cookware. The Portable Crock Pot cooks 25% faster than the Crock Pot. It can also cook food items exclusive to it and DST (see [Portable Crock Pot](/wiki/Portable_Crock_Pot "Portable Crock Pot") for recipes). Seasoned foods have additional benefits such as increasing work efficiency, increasing attack damage, or heightening damage absorption. Warly also only takes half as long (0.5 seconds) as other Characters (1 second) to [cook](/wiki/Cooking "Cooking") food.

When Warly inspects food, he will now comment if it is something he ate recently.

## Disadvantage[]

In DST, Warly's hunger drain is 20% faster than normal characters. He is also completely unable to eat food that is not a prepared dish from a Crock Pot. He remembers the food he has eaten for 2 days. The first repetition of the food item applies 10% penalty, the second 20%, the third 35%, the fourth 50% and finally the fifth repetition applies 70% penalty on the food values. Any further repetition does not increase this penalty.

Warly is the only character who doesn't have a [favorite food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together"), meaning he will only ever receive a dish's baseline Hunger value.

Differently from SW, Warly does not gain bonus Hunger, Health, and Sanity from Crock Pot dishes.

## Prototype Tips[]

### Feeding Warly[]

For hunger management, [Tall Scotch Eggs](/wiki/Tall_Scotch_Eggs "Tall Scotch Eggs") and [Meaty Stew](/wiki/Meaty_Stew "Meaty Stew") are clear winners. They each provide 150 hunger and keep for 10-15 days. Carrying just one or two types of dishes saves inventory space. Simplicity is valuable for this complex character. In a solo Warly world, consider basing near (but not too near) [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird").

### Things to Build[]

* [Bundling Wrap](/wiki/Bundling_Wrap "Bundling Wrap") stops spoilage entirely. For farming and cooking, a [Salt Box](/wiki/Salt_Box "Salt Box"), [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box"), [Insulated Pack](/wiki/Insulated_Pack "Insulated Pack"), or [Chef Pouch](/wiki/Chef_Pouch "Chef Pouch") each help to lesser degrees. [Drying Racks](/wiki/Drying_Rack "Drying Rack") aren't as useful to Warly since he cannot eat dried meats directly.
* [Bee Boxes](/wiki/Bee_Box "Bee Box") provide [Honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey") for [Honey Crystals](/wiki/Honey_Crystals "Honey Crystals") and more crock pot dishes.
* A [Birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage") produces seeds from vegetables, expands recipe variety, recycles soon-to-rot food, and generates fertilizer ([Guano](/wiki/Guano "Guano")) from unwanted crop seeds.

### Why Play Warly?[]

* Warly's combat-boosting dishes and spices might make him the most powerful support character. [Volt Goat Chaud-Froid](/wiki/Volt_Goat_Chaud-Froid "Volt Goat Chaud-Froid") seasoned with [Chili Flakes](/wiki/Chili_Flakes "Chili Flakes") greatly increases damage output. [Garlic Powder](/wiki/Garlic_Powder "Garlic Powder") reduces damage taken (great with [Jellybeans](/wiki/Jellybeans "Jellybeans") which never spoil and restore health for 2 minutes). Woodie-as-a-Moose can't boost his stats any other way and doesn't have to worry about durability.
* Warly is great for players who want to reap the maximum benefits from farming, fishing, and cooking. In multiplayer, others can help farm and gather while he focuses on meal prep and seasoning.
* Being forced to focus on finding new recipes and utilizing the cookbook item creates a very unique feeling when playing, encouraging experimenting with trial and error on recipes, and going out of your way to gather different food types.

### Farming for Warly[]

* \*\*Top Priorities:\*\* [Peppers](/wiki/Pepper "Pepper") ([Chili Flakes](/wiki/Chili_Flakes "Chili Flakes")) and [Garlic](/wiki/Garlic "Garlic") ([Garlic Powder](/wiki/Garlic_Powder "Garlic Powder"))
* \*\*Secondary:\*\* [Onions](/wiki/Onion "Onion") ([Grim Galette](/wiki/Grim_Galette "Grim Galette") and many of his specialty dishes) and [Corn](/wiki/Corn "Corn") ([Powdercakes](/wiki/Powdercake "Powdercake") which can be seasoned and don't spoil)
* \*\*Tertiary:\*\* [Potatoes](/wiki/Potato "Potato") ([Grim Galette](/wiki/Grim_Galette "Grim Galette")), [Toma Root](/wiki/Toma_Root "Toma Root") ([Moqueca](/wiki/Moqueca "Moqueca")), and any [Fruit](/wiki/Fruit "Fruit") ([Glow Berry Mousse](/wiki/Glow_Berry_Mousse "Glow Berry Mousse"))

Grow Peppers, Garlic, and Onions together for a perfect nutrient balance. All three are in season during Summer and Fall. Grow them under a [Cave Light](/wiki/Cave_Light "Cave Light") or [Knobbly Tree](/wiki/Knobbly_Tree "Knobbly Tree") to avoid overheating and fires during summer.

### Random Tips[]

* [Healing Filter](/wiki/Healing_Filter "Healing Filter") items are more practical than food-based healing due to his repeat-dish penalties.
* His Chef Pouch lets him keep ingredients and dishes longer, extending his range. Before an [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box") can be built, drop the Pouch next to the crock pots.
* Like [Traps](/wiki/Trap "Trap"), Portable Crock Pots are visible on the map and can be used as markers.
* Warly's initial 2 Potatoes and 1 Garlic are enough to cook [Fancy Spiralled Tubers](/wiki/Fancy_Spiralled_Tubers "Fancy Spiralled Tubers") or [Creamy Potato Purée](/wiki/Creamy_Potato_Pur%C3%A9e "Creamy Potato Purée") to stave off early hunger and sanity loss (or feed to a bird for crop-specific seeds).
