**Don't Starve: Pocket Edition** was released on July 9, 2015 for Apple and Android devices. The first version of the game included all the content of the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, with very minor changes. A second app was released on December 26, 2016, and included all the content in the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC.

## Differences between Pocket Edition and other Platforms[]

Unlike other ports of *Don't Starve*, *Pocket Edition*'s controls comprise of three(3) buttons and an optional joystick wheel. The buttons, one red with a black fist, one green with a splayed hand and an orange button with a "cycle" symbol, are displayed on the right side of the screen. The red button can be used to attack the closest [mob](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") to the player, excluding followers. Alternatively, the player can attack hostile creatures by tapping on them while holding a tool or weapon. The green button is used to perform most other actions such as picking up items and harvesting plants. The Orange button allows the player to repeatedly craft the last item/structure created if they have the necessary materials. If the last item created is a structure, the player will have to move in order to create the new structure.

A sprite of the structure/plant that the player wants to position will appear in front of the player's character in the intuition to help in the construction of the base, if it is possible to place the object it will be green, otherwise it will be red.

Due to limitations of the controls, it is currently impossible to access certain character's examination quotes relating to certain mobs or [structures](/wiki/Structures "Structures"), especially if the mob/structure has a storage use. This also applies to unharvested resources, as touching it will automatically send the player to collect it. (Using Bluetooth controller makes it possible for all quotes to be accessed)

Another trade-in of the mobile platform is that game world and sprite resolution is of noticeably lower quality. This is presumably due to the limitations of the window and graphics engine. Cinematic elements, such as non-player [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell")'s appearances, still appear in higher resolution due to their simpler purpose and requirements.

In [World Customization](/wiki/World_Customization/Reign_of_Giants "World Customization/Reign of Giants") settings, there is a new preset named No-Sweat Mode*,* an easier game mode, allowing for a more relaxed play style.

## No-Sweat Mode[]

No-Sweat mode is a preset only available in the *Reign of Giants* DLC and is meant for less experienced players. Many features can be modified or even turned off, such as [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"), [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing"), and attacks from [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie"). No-Sweat Mode is available both for the Apple and Android version of the game.

### Changes made in No-Sweat Mode[]

* The player takes 35% less damage.
* [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") loss during [Dusk](/wiki/Dusk "Dusk") and [Night](/wiki/Night "Night") is -2.5/minute.
* Hunger drains slower, and when dying of hunger, [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") is lost at 0.5/sec. Health will only drain to 25% of the player's total health. https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/67/A669D42E-606A-4B13-9B29-362589813F2D.png/revision/latest?cb=20190622235715 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/67/A669D42E-606A-4B13-9B29-362589813F2D.png/revision/latest?cb=20190622235715 

  Wilson and the Compromising Statue side by side.
* When [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie/Normal "Woodie/Normal") is in [Werebeaver form](/wiki/Woodie/Cursed "Woodie/Cursed"), he does 50% more damage and the log meter drains slower.
* The Player respawns at the [Compromising Statue](/wiki/Compromising_Statue "Compromising Statue") after dying instead of the world being deleted.
* No effects from low [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"). The [Nightmare Amulet](/wiki/Nightmare_Amulet "Nightmare Amulet") and [Nightmare Lights](/wiki/Nightmare_Light "Nightmare Light") still spawn [Shadow Creature](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature")[s](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature").
* No attacks from Charlie, the brightness appears the same as when on a full moon. [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") do turn into [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig"), [Glommer](/wiki/Glommer "Glommer") does not spawn, etc.
* No death by [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing").
* [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops") and [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") (*Reign of Giants*) are automatically set to "None".
* Hound Attacks are automatically set to "Less".
* Naturally spawning [Carrots](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot") are automatically set to "More".
* Trees and other plants grow faster.

## MosquitoBugs[]

* While using "Tap to move", after using the green button and selecting the inventory at the same, time the controls may freeze, making the player unable to move. This can be combated by using the control wheel instead.
* It's is possible for no [Giants](/wiki/Giants "Giants") to spawn, even if they are all set to default. It randomly happens in specific worlds and only those worlds, meaning if a world has spawned a giant once, one will never experience this bug in that world. This is caused by a bug in the world generation.
* There is a chance for the world to not generate both of the desert biomes if the game is set to "no-sweat mode" resulting in dragonfly not spawning permanently, This is caused by a bug in the world generation and the option for dragonfly being automatically off that messes the game world generation up.
* [Giants](/wiki/Giants "Giants") can spawn when they aren't supposed to. This can mean spawning even when they are set to "none" and/or out of their intended season. This is caused by a bug in the world generation.
* In [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"), when escaping one world and going into the next, it may lead the player to the screen that normally appears when they die. Afterwards, the player will be respawned in front of the [Maxwell's Door](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door").
* Supposedly the game can sometimes crash if one enters the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins").
* The player cannot hide in a [Bush Hat](/wiki/Bush_Hat "Bush Hat") while having a backpack equipped
* The Leafy Berry Bush texture has a sprite glitch while dug, returning the earth will resolve the glitch as it's just a sprite glitch of the item itself on the ground, inventory or container, not the plant

## Shipwrecked icon Shipwrecked[]

In the *Shipwrecked* DLC, the [Seaworthy](/wiki/Seaworthy "Seaworthy") cannot be used. This is because there are two separate apps. All [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") are automatically unlocked, except for [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") and [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") who are not in the game

## Questions from comments[]

  + R: Yes and No, the Ruins can be found below the caves, mining a [Thuelecite](/wiki/Thulecite "Thulecite") [Sinkhole](/wiki/Sinkhole "Sinkhole"), but the Atrium is not present as it is exclusive to [Daylight Savings Time (Together)](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")
