The **Infernal Staff** is an item added to *[The Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge")* event in *Don't Starve Together*. Dropped by the last enemy killed on wave 7.

This item fires fireballs that deal 25 damage to the target. Like darts, these projectiles cannot miss their target.

Infernal Staff Special Ability - Call Cataclysm: When used, a meteor impact area appears, as the meteorite itself falls, dealing high damage in the area from 200 to 250 to all enemies caught in this area. The closer the enemies stand to the center, the more damage they take. Also able to rarely deal critical hits with increased damage by 1.5 times.

The staff deals magic and fire damage, causing Willow's ability and projectile damage to be increased by 10%.

## Prototype Tips[]

* The staff's special ability is for crowd control. The staff user is advised to cast the spell on a large cluster of enemies.
* While casting the spell, it is recommended to stay away from enemy warriors: if they hit the staff owner during the summoning animation, the spell will be canceled.
* If Willow is on the team, it is recommended to leave the staff to her. Increased fire damage affects both normal attacks and call of cataclysm (220-275).
* Wickerbottom is also a good user of the infernal staff: good damage helps to quickly strengthen the next spell, and the enhanced call of the cataclysm deals 300-375 damage, which, when wearing a psychic crown, can kill boars from hell in one hit (useful in a boss battle).
* Another candidate for using the staff is Maxwell: when inflicting 10 attacks on one target, his shadow clones appear, causing good damage with their wave. This can be done with any item, however, attacking via the Codes Umbra, Maxwell may die due to his depleting amount of health, and it is better to leave the staff of life to a character who has bonuses for healing.
