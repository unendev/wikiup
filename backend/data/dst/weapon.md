**“**My cömrade in arms!**”**

–[Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid")

**Weapons** are [Items](/wiki/Items "Items") used to fight, hunt and defend oneself from creatures in *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")*. Most weapons have a durability, limiting the number of times it can be used.

In the hostile wilderness, a player's bare hands won't stand up well to many of the hostile creatures found or be able to hunt very effectively, while running can get one safely out of harm's way at first, a player will need to start utilizing weapons for self-defense, hunting, and especially for the periodic [Hound](/wiki/Hound "Hound") attacks, or other fast, persistent enemies.

Some characters have personal damage modifiers. [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes") and [Wendy](/wiki/Wendy "Wendy") deal normal damage × 0.75, [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") deals normal damage × 1.25, [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang") deals normal damage × 0.50-2.00 (based on [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") level), and [Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda") deals normal damage × 0.50-1.75 (depend on her age and weapon type). All characters' unarmed attacks deal 10 points of damage per hit, and can be executed only once every second while armed ones can be executed twice, making characters' unarmed attacks impractical for combat.

Any other item that equips to the hand slot, such as [Divining Rod](/wiki/Divining_Rod "Divining Rod") and [Umbrella](/wiki/Umbrella "Umbrella"), can be used to attack with the use of the Force Attack command/button, but will only do as much damage as an unarmed attack. Using items this way won't deplete the item's durability any more than holding it normally does.
