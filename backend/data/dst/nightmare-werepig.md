The **Nightmare Werepig** is a [Boss Monster](/wiki/Boss_Monster "Boss Monster") exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, introduced in the [Wilson Rework](/wiki/Wilson_Refresh "Wilson Refresh") Update. It spawns in the [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") muddy biome two days after starting a world and appears to be a much larger and powerful variant of the [Werepig](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig").

## Behavior[]

The boss spawns ensnared by shadow chains between three [Cracked Pillars](/wiki/Cracked_Pillar "Cracked Pillar") and asks to be released. To do this, the outer [Marble](/wiki/Marble "Marble") layer needs to be mined off of each pillar with any pickaxe, then the player must make each exposed pillar shake at the same time with a hit from a [Pick/Axe](/wiki/Pick/Axe "Pick/Axe"). After all pillars are shaking at the same time, the Nightmare Werepig breaks free from its chains. However, its torment does not end there.

**"Phase 0" / Parasitic Shadelings**

After being freed from the chains, the Nightmare Werepig is constantly attacked by small [Parasitic Shadelings](/wiki/Parasitic_Shadeling "Parasitic Shadeling") and is invulnerable to other attacks. The shadow creatures have 100 health and 6 movement speed. Like other shadow creatures, they can only be attacked at low Sanity. The pig is constantly fighting shadows and can inflict 12.5 damage to anything in the crossfire. To start the fight proper, a player must go below the survivor's insanity threshold and kill the parasites after they are thrown off the boss. The Nightmare Werepig has a -800/min insanity aura during this phase to make this easier. After all Shadelings are killed, the fight begins.

### Phase 1[]

The Nightmare Werepig attacks via a powerful lunge that deals 75 damage and knocks the target on the ground, which forces them to waste time getting back up. This attack will also dismount a beefalo rider. To dodge the lunge, the player should run diagonally towards the Nightmare Werepig. For example, if the Nightmare chases the player downwards, the player should run diagonally up just before the jump. This attack will be easier to dodge with a [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane") or other speed boosts active. Between sets of jumps, it will walk slowly until the next set, which it will start running directly at the survivor. During this break, you can rotate the camera to a more comfortable angle to prepare for the next round. This attack is used throughout the fight, so it's important to learn how to dodge it properly.

The Nightmare Werepig has a fatigue stat that changes based on the success of its attacks. When it misses an attack, its fatigue is increased by 1, but when it lands an attack successfully, it is decreased by 1.5. Fatigue also decreases passively, with one unit after 20 seconds and then again after 10 seconds when out of combat. When the boss's fatigue reaches 3 units (3 misses), it falls to its knees and rests its paws on the ground, eliminating fatigue but allowing the player to deal significant damage. However, if you do not attack the boss while it is resting, it will rapidly regenerate 20 health units every 0.4 seconds. This state will last between 5 and 10 seconds. Successful dodging is very important in order to keep the fight short.

Between series of jumps, the Nightmare Werepig stops running around the battlefield and begins to "stalk" the player, continuously following a player with its eyes and turning its head following their movements. While stalking, it regenerates 10 health every 0.4 seconds. In addition to healing during combat, the boss also regenerates 25 health per second if the character moves far enough to end the fight. After losing half its health, the boss enters its second phase.

### Phase 2[]

In the second phase, the boss begins to almost exclusively use a ground slam that deals 112.5 damage and leaving behind a short lived [Antlion](/wiki/Antlion "Antlion")-like sinkhole with a radius of 3 units. Notably, the boss does not get fatigued from ground slam attacks, and may attack a player for as long as they remain in range and the attack is not on its short cooldown. These blows are the only way to destroy the Cracked Pillars, which gives 3-4 [Dreadstone](/wiki/Dreadstone "Dreadstone").

If the player is keeping their distance from the boss, they will begin "stalking" once more, healing rapidly. If players allow the boss to do this for enough time, it charges at a player with its lunge attack. After being reduced to 30% health, the boss enters its third and final phase.

### Phase 3[]

Phase 3 simply consists of the boss lunging at the player, interchanged with the recently introduced ground slam attack. Additionally, the boss will follow up any successful lunge attacks with a ground slam, and attack nearby players with a ground slam immediately after its fatigue ends. As the boss will begin using primarily the lunge over the slam, this phase can be handled near identically to phase 1, dodging the boss' lunges and attacking when it is fatigued.

### Defeat[]

After defeating the boss, it does not die, instead falling exhausted and warning the survivor that the fight isn't over. This happens for a few minutes, after which the boss (and pillars if they were not destroyed) disappear. On defeat, it drops from four to five units of [Pure Horror](/wiki/Pure_Horror "Pure Horror"), one [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") and [Rare Blueprints](/wiki/Blueprint "Blueprint") for [Dreadstone Armor](/wiki/Dreadstone_Armor "Dreadstone Armor"), [Dreadstone Helm](/wiki/Dreadstone_Helm "Dreadstone Helm"), [Dreadstone Wall](/wiki/Dreadstone_Wall "Dreadstone Wall"), and [Reinforced Dreadstone Pillar](/wiki/Reinforced_Dreadstone_Pillar "Reinforced Dreadstone Pillar"). Afterward, Nightmare Werepig no longer respawns, as it instead comes back as the [Scrappy Werepig](/wiki/Scrappy_Werepig "Scrappy Werepig") 10 in-game days later. After defeating its scrappy form, it reappears in the caves as the Nightmare Werepig after another 10 in-game days.

## Tips[]

* If players do not use the Nightmare Werepig to destroy the Cracked Pillars, they will not receive [Dreadstone](/wiki/Dreadstone "Dreadstone") for completing the fight, making it substantially less worth doing. It's important to lure the boss towards the pillars as soon as it starts using its slam attacks for this reason.
  + The difficulty of this fight is comparable to [Ancient Guardian](/wiki/Ancient_Guardian "Ancient Guardian"), though it may require more preparation prior. It's timeliest to start this fight around the players' first few expeditions to the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins")/[Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves"), sometime after defeating Ancient Guardian.
* [Cooked Green](/wiki/Green_Cap "Green Cap")/[Blue Caps](/wiki/Blue_Cap "Blue Cap"), [Banana Shakes](/wiki/Banana_Shake "Banana Shake"), or other means of sanity recovery is recommended for the fight, as the boss' high negative sanity aura combined with the passive sanity drain of the Caves can quickly result in the fight becoming unmanageable due to [Shadow Creature](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") attacks.
  + Heavy damage dealers like [Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda") or [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang") may be able to fend off attacks from Shadow Creatures in lieu of keeping sanity high, though this is recommended only for parties of more than 1-2 players or particularly skilled players.
* Light sources should be considered prior to starting the fight.
  + A [Star Caller's Staff](/wiki/Star_Caller%27s_Staff "Star Caller's Staff") is the easiest way to keep the area illuminated. As a [Pick/Axe](/wiki/Pick/Axe "Pick/Axe") is required to even begin the fight, players may want to create a Star Caller's Staff in addition while in the Ruins.
  + While the Nightmare Werepig's spawn point is likely to be near a large open area containing many [Light Flowers](/wiki/Light_Flower "Light Flower"), these will flicker on and off mid fight and will occasionally plunge the player into darkness.
  + As usual, [Campfires](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire"), [Miner Hats](/wiki/Miner_Hat "Miner Hat"), and [Lanterns](/wiki/Lantern "Lantern") can be used, though these may be dangerous to use as they all require fuel and provide a meager light radius, and must be tended to/equipped in favor of weapons or armor.
* During phase 2, it can be difficult for players to get damage on the Nightmare Werepig, particularly if facing the boss alone.
  + Attempting to trigger lunges out of the boss and fatiguing it is inefficient, as it will heal from all of the damage the player could possibly deal after finally fatiguing it.
  + The best strategy for a single player is to trigger a slam attack, run directly backwards from the boss to dodge the attack, then run directly back towards the boss and land 2-3 hits before it runs away. Doing this prevents the player from getting stuck in the ensuing crater while still allowing an opportunity to damage the boss without it healing.
  + Proper use of [Walking Canes](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane") can be crucial in avoiding attacks. If needed, equipping a [Magiluminescence](/wiki/Magiluminescence "Magiluminescence") as well can give the player even more breathing room.
* Nightmare Werepig's lunges will throw players off of their mounted [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo"). Keeping the Beefalo's obedience level high is important in this fight to be able to mount it again as quickly as possible, as it will die swiftly to the boss if provoked.
* After the fight, [Construction Amulets](/wiki/Construction_Amulet "Construction Amulet") are recommended for crafting both [Dreadstone Armor](/wiki/Dreadstone_Armor "Dreadstone Armor") and [Dreadstone Helms](/wiki/Dreadstone_Helm "Dreadstone Helm"), which can save the player time from re-fighting the boss.
  + 5 Dreadstone is required later in progression in order to begin the [Shadow Rift Cycle](/wiki/Shadow_Rifts "Shadow Rifts"), so it's prudent to set that amount of Dreadstone aside for future use.
  + At the cost of the durability of a Construction Amulet and a [Deconstruction Staff](/wiki/Deconstruction_Staff "Deconstruction Staff"), Dreadstone and Pure Horror may be duplicated by repeatedly constructing and deconstructing Dreadstone Armor, as the deconstructed armor will leave behind the base amount of resources needed to craft it, even if it was crafted at a discount via a Construction Amulet. This can be more economic to players who have the [Green Gems](/wiki/Green_Gem "Green Gem") to craft the needed tools, but do not wish to invest more time fighting Nightmare Werepig again.
