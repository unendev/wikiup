Night can be a very confusing time for novice players, especially since venturing out into the night is fatal.

## Night's Effects []

#### Without a Lightsource[]

* The player will be alerted that [Charlie (Night Monster)](/wiki/Charlie_(Night_Monster) "Charlie (Night Monster)") is near. After 5 seconds the player is attacked and damaged for 100 health and 20 sanity.
* (Armor will absorb damage taken from Charlie.) 10 seconds later it will attack again, causing the same amount of damage.
* 50 sanity/min is drained while in the darkness. (0.83 sanity/second)
* You will be unable to pick up items or interact with objects using the mouse button. Objects can still be collected by using the space bar, but due to the games natural tendency to go towards any object instead of the closest one, this is an ineffective way to gather materials for a torch or a fire.

#### With a Lightsource[]

* 5 sanity/min is drained while near light. [Verified]

#### On the World[]

* Mobs will fall asleep as soon as night starts and will wake when night is over. **Note:** Some mobs sleep during the day instead, especially if their home is destroyed (such as the [Spider](/wiki/Spider "Spider") and the [Spider Warrior](/wiki/Spider_Warrior "Spider Warrior").) However, the combat reaction below is the same. Other creatures that sleep during the day may wake when near but are neutral mobs (such as a [Bunnyman](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman")) instead and will react as a [pig](/wiki/Pig "Pig") without its home.
  + If the player walks near a sleeping [Spider](/wiki/Spider "Spider"), [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen"), [Killer Bee](/wiki/Killer_Bee "Killer Bee"), [Tallbird](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird"), or [Hound](/wiki/Hound "Hound") it will wake up and attack the player, unless they are part of one of Maxwell's traps. If so, they will continue to sleep until an event triggers them.
  + If the player attacks a sleeping [Spider](/wiki/Spider "Spider"), [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen"), [Bee](/wiki/Bee "Bee"), [Killer Bee](/wiki/Killer_Bee "Killer Bee"), [Tallbird](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird"), [Hound](/wiki/Hound "Hound"), [Treeguard](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard"), or [Pig](/wiki/Pig "Pig"), it and its nearby allies will wake and attack the player.
  + If the player walks nearby a sleeping Koalefant or Winter Koalefant it will wake up and start running away. There is just enough time to attack it with a melee weapon if you are quick. (A torch works.)
  + The pig king will be asleep and will not be able to receive any gifts in exchange for gold.
* Plants will not grow.
* Meat will not dry.
* Tallbird eggs (unless in a nest or near a fire) will freeze and turn to [Wet Goop](/wiki/Wet_Goop "Wet Goop").

## Light[]

In order to survive the night, the player needs to be near a light. Light sources are listed from best to worst:

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/33/Fire Pit.png/revision/latest?cb=20121216093816

### Fire Pit[]

Cost: 12 [Rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks") and 2 [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log")

Cost to maintain: [Fuel](/wiki/Fire#Fuel "Fire")

Cost rank: Expensive initial placement, maintenance is low, high reuse value

Light area: Large, grows smaller as fire weakens

Mobility: Stationary

Rank: Good, the most efficient method to stay warm during winter

Usage: The optimal choice for a base or an area where you know you will stay for a while or come back to. It is much more efficient in the long term than any other light source, lasting up to 6 minutes. It is also used to stay warm during winter and cook food.

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f6/Endothermic Fire Pit Build.png/revision/latest?cb=20220331173755

### Endothermic Fire Pit[]

Cost: 2 [Nitre](/wiki/Nitre "Nitre") , 4 [Cut Stones](/wiki/Cut_Stone "Cut Stone") and 2 [Electrical Doodads](/wiki/Electrical_Doodad "Electrical Doodad")

Cost to maintain: [Fuel](/wiki/Fire#Fuel "Fire"), [Nitre](/wiki/Nitre "Nitre")

Cost rank: Extremely expensive initial placement, maintenance is low, high reuse value

Light area: Large, grows smaller as fire weakens

Mobility: Stationary

Rank: Good, the most efficient method to stay cool during summer

Usage: Essentially a cold Fire Pit, this Fire Pit cools you down, making surviving the summer much easier. The downside to this is the huge expense that is required to build this.

Note: Endothermic fires are only able to be built in a world with the Reign Of Giants DLC.

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/0/01/Campfire.png/revision/latest?cb=20121215202235

### Campfire[]

Cost: 3 [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass") and 2 [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log")

Cost to maintain: [Fuel](/wiki/Fire "Fire")

Cost rank: Moderately expensive to place, low to maintain. Must be replaced with every new use.

Light area: Large, grows smaller as fire weakens.

Mobility: Stationary

Rank: Good, but inefficient for long term usage

Usage: Optimal for new players during the night, useful for keeping warm during winter when not having access to a Fire Pit, and can be used for cooking food.

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/0/05/Endothermic Fire Build.png/revision/latest?cb=20220331173735

### Endothermic Fire[]

Cost: 3 [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass") and 2 [Nitre](/wiki/Nitre "Nitre")

Cost to maintain: [Fuel](/wiki/Fire "Fire"), [Nitre](/wiki/Nitre "Nitre")

Cost rank: Moderately expensive to place, low to maintain. Must be replaced with every new use.

Light area: Large, grows smaller as fire weakens.

Mobility: Stationary

Rank: Good, but inefficient for long term usage

Usage: An alternative for players who are surviving summer. Also useful in a pinch when there are no logs about.

Note: Endothermic fires are only able to be built in a world with the Reign Of Giants DLC.

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b2/Torch.png/revision/latest?cb=20121216162140

### Torch[]

Cost: 2 [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass") and 2 [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs")

Cost to maintain: Single use only, however can be put down or unequipped to keep use down.

Cost rank: Moderately inexpensive to craft

Light area: Small

Mobility: High, equipped. Must be held in hand to give light.

Warmth: Used to set things on fire, trees burn longest and give charcoal when chopped down after burning.

Rank: Good depending on the situation; inefficient to use regularly.

Usage: Optimal for travel during early game, and very effective for temporarily restoring warmth during winter by setting things on fire.

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/30/Icon Light.png/revision/latest?cb=20210625093003

### Fire[]

Cost: Torch or firestaff is used to start the fire, and a tree or burnable item.

Cost to maintain: A tree lasts for 10–15 seconds, an item placed on the ground lasts 3–15 seconds.[[1]](#cite_note-1) Firestaff uses 1 charge.

Cost rank: Supply cost for tool used, only.

Light area: Huge, depending on item(s) burned.

Warmth: Provides warmth, can be used to heat up a heat stone up to about 1/3 from 1 fire.

Rank: Bad, a fire lasts a very short time but has a very large light area.

Usage: Almost free way to restore warmth during winter.

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/1f/Miner Hat.png/revision/latest?cb=20121216102844

### Miner Hat[]

Cost 1 [Straw Hat](/wiki/Straw_Hat "Straw Hat"), 1 [Gold Nugget](/wiki/Gold_Nugget "Gold Nugget") and 1 [Fireflies](/wiki/Fireflies "Fireflies"), and it requires an [Alchemy Engine](/wiki/Alchemy_Engine "Alchemy Engine") to prototype

Cost to maintain: 1 Gold Nugget and 1 fireflies. Last for a very long time, about 4-5 nights before having to refuel.

Cost rank: Cheap, but takes some effort to find and get materials. Fireflies are not renewable, but are abundant. (Fireflies stack up to 40, so up to 160 of them they can be brought over to a new world)

Light area: Large.

Mobility: High, worn as a hat

Warmth: None

Rank: Arguably the lightsource of choice, it lasts about 4-5 nights if used only at night. The only downside is that Fireflies are not renewable, however abundant.

Usage: Any time light is needed.
