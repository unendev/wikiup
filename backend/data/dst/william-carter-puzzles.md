William Carter

### Start date

May 17th, 2013

### End date

October 22nd, 2013

**“**This poor, unsuspecting fool has no idea what's coming.**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell")

The **William Carter Puzzles** are a set of puzzles hidden by [Klei](/wiki/Klei "Klei") in update trailers for *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* starting with the *[Underground](/wiki/Version_History#Underground "Version History")* update and ending with the *[All's Well that Maxwell](/wiki/Version_History#October_22nd,_2013_-_All's_Well_that_Maxwell "Version History")* update.

In the trailers, there would often be hidden text (with some variation) or parts of hidden text that are not easy to spot in the video without closer inspection. The hidden text would lead to links for images that reveal the backstory of [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(NPC) "Maxwell (NPC)"), whose original name was William Carter, before the main events of the [game's story](/wiki/Story_Line "Story Line"). As the puzzles go on, [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") is introduced as well.

## First puzzle[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f1/William Carter Puzzle 1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220830190834 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f1/William Carter Puzzle 1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220830190834 

First puzzle

 

[The first puzzle](https://web.archive.org/web/20130608022646/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/1/all-aboard.html) leads to William's inspection card that says APPROVED, boarding a ship named *Quest* to the United States. In real life, the White Star Line ship *[Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Celtic_(1901) "wikipedia:RMS Celtic (1901)")* had its maiden voyage on July 26, 1901 from Liverpool, England to New York City. This is the same date and port of departure as William's voyage on the *Quest*.

Second puzzle

 

[The second puzzle](https://web.archive.org/web/20130614025212/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/2/abracadabra.html) leads to an advertisement for William's magic show at Bowery Hall. The advertisement has a picture of William pulling a rabbit out of a hat. William's face is scratched out. The poster is partially covered by other advertisements, suggesting that the show wasn't very successful. Bowery Hall may be a reference to the [Bowery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowery "wikipedia:Bowery") neighborhood of Manhattan. The text on the ad reads:

:   *WILLIAM CARTER*
:   *PERFORMING FEATS OF THE MYSTERIOUS FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT AND EDIFICATION.*
:   *MAGICIAN*

## Third puzzle[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a7/William Carter Puzzle 3.png/revision/latest?cb=20220830191217 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a7/William Carter Puzzle 3.png/revision/latest?cb=20220830191217 

Third puzzle

 

[The third puzzle](https://web.archive.org/web/20130702065648/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/3/hard-times.html) shows a desk with multiple papers on it. One of them is a bill from a man named George T. Witherstone for magician's props totaling $7.10. There is a large red 'OVERDUE' stamped on the bottom. The date on the bill is covered by another paper, but the word *May* can be seen. The props are a set of marked cards, a gimmicked top hat, and two docile rabbits (which cost $2).

Another paper appears to be a note to William, which reads:

:   *William!*
:   *You are late again!* *Where is the muny? Do you think Mr. Witherstone is runnin a charatee? You better pay up this week or there will be trubble! I will find you!* [sic]

There is also a postcard on the desk from Jack Carter, William's brother. Next to it is a postcard from California, suggesting that Jack may be sending the letter from there. The address is *William Carter* / *21 Harold St.* / *New York, NY*.

The letter reads:

:   *William,*

:   *You've finally come to America! How exciting! Has your show taken New York by storm yet? I fear we may have just missed each other - the city was too much for me, so I've gone west - It really is amazing out here - maybe you could visit sometime?*

:   *Have you corresponded with mother lately? The post is dreadfully inconsistent out here, I can't believe she hasn't met the twins yet!*

:   *Warmest regards,*
:   -*Jack.*

[Harold Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/21+Harold+St,+Staten+Island,+NY+10314/@40.6020241,-74.1250105,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c24e9c2caf037b:0x6763d6749cd15824!8m2!3d40.6020119!4d-74.120815521) is a real location in Staten Island, NY. The twins are Jack's daughters, [Wendy](/wiki/Wendy "Wendy") and [Abigail Carter](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail").

## Fourth puzzle[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/50/William Carter Puzzle 4.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150502152049 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/50/William Carter Puzzle 4.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150502152049 

Fourth puzzle

 

[The fourth puzzle](https://web.archive.org/web/20130726021201/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/4/dark-enlightenment.html) is an article from a newspaper, a circus poster, some blueprints of what appears to be an [obelisk](/wiki/Obelisk "Obelisk"), a postcard to Jack Carter, and a Coach Ticket. In the source code, there is [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art "wikipedia:ASCII art") of a Shadow Watcher.

The incident described in this puzzle was later shown in [Wolfgang's Animated Short](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#The_Incredible_Strongman "Animated Shorts and Trailers"), where it's revealed that when the train crashed, William Carter was pinned under a broken train car. The strongman, [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang"), who had been in the circus wagon, rushed to help save Carter. While Wolfgang was attempting to lift the train car off of him, some shadow tendrils came out of a [book](/wiki/Codex_Umbra "Codex Umbra") Carter was carrying and imbued Wolfgang with even greater strength. With this boost to his power, Wolfgang was able to throw the entire train car off of William Carter. However, Carter was horrified that someone had seen his use of dark magic. The Shadows left Wolfgang and returned to the book, as Carter turned away and ran off into the desert.

### The Newspaper[]

The Newspaper reads:

:   *TRAGIC TRAIN CRASH*
:   *Circus wagon struck at crossing*
:   *Many passenger injuries reported*
:   *Elephant unharmed*

:   *A passenger​ train struck a circus wagon that had broken down along the tracks at the Old Mill crossing. Dozens of passengers were injured, and at least one man is missing. The missing man has yet to be identified, but fellow passengers described him as a tall, nervous fellow with an English accent. A search party was convened but quickly abandoned when it became apparent that a* [Second column begins after tear in the first column] *cage full of potentially dangerous trained monkeys had been vacated in the collision. Given the remoteness of the crash site, the scorching desert sun, and the escaped animals, the missing man has been presumed dead.*

:   *This is the third such incident at the crossing since the railway's construction in 1873, but the first to involve a circus wagon. Local businessman and railway investor Harold J. Rutherford assured this publication that all pertinent safety precautions had been taken, but no one could have foreseen the appearance of such a dangerous blockage on the tracks*

The date of the paper is August 23, 1904.

### The Circus Poster[]

The Circus poster has the words ABERNETHY & PARKER CIRCUS written at the top. There is an elephant balanced on a ball with flamingos on its back and left ear. A man is balanced on its head on one hand. Two monkeys wearing fezes are standing next to the ball.

Below this picture it reads:

:   *COMING TO YOUR TOWN!*

:   *GOOD SPRINGS BULLFROG DELAMAR ROUND MOUNTAIN*

:   *KLONDYKE HARSHAW CHARLESTON FAIRBANK*

:   *DON'T MISS THE INCREDIBLE STRONGMAN*

Most of the cities reported above are actual ghost towns in Arizona and Nevada, which were abandoned after the gold rush. The Strongman mentioned in the advertisement is [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang").

### The Postcard[]

The postcard to Jack Carter reads:

:   *Jack,*

:   *The strangest thing has happened! Please discount all reports of my demise, should they reach you. I am very much alive, despite my recent misadventures. I have discovered something, a [book](/wiki/Codex_Umbra "Codex Umbra") of sorts. I have yet to decode it fully, but what little I have deciphered has opened my mind to terrifying new possibilities. I shan't say more through post - I fear it may attract unwanted attention. All will be explained when we meet. I shall continue west forthwith!*
:   *-William*

The address has been scribbled out with red ink, but can still be read as *Jack Carter, 33, 4th St, Corona, CA, 91720*. [Corona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona "wikipedia:Corona") is a city situated in Southern California that goes by the zip code 91720. The postcard is postmarked in North Fork, Nevada, another ghost town.

### The Coach Ticket[]

The coach ticket reads:

:   *SUNSET LINES*
:   *NEW YORK (GRAND CENTRAL) TO:*
:   *San Francisco - Mission Stn. (Exc'nge)*
:   *Date: August 15th, 1904*

There is some red text running down the left and right hand side reading *No. 702*, and a black stamp at the bottom reading *COACH CLASS*.

#### The Obelisk Blueprint[]

There is no readable text on the obelisk blueprint, but there are many symbols and measurement lines. The page appears to be torn out of something, possibly the book mentioned in Willam's postcard. The symbols on the blueprint are identical to a series of runes featured in the [Metheus Puzzles](/wiki/Metheus_Puzzles "Metheus Puzzles").

### Background[]

The ground is made of cracked dry rock, suggesting a desert. Two shadows are standing over the scene. The shadow on the left is indistinct, and the shadow on the right heavily resembles a [Shadow Watcher](/wiki/Shadow_Creature#Shadow_Watcher "Shadow Creature").

In the source code, there is ASCII art of the [Shadow Watcher](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature").

The name of this picture was "maxwell-the-great.jpg"

 

## Fifth puzzle[]

[The fifth puzzle](https://web.archive.org/web/20130821132017/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/5/ladies-and-gentlemen.html) shows a poster advertising *Maxwell the Great*. Below the poster is a classified ad requisition. Also, a sketch of both the [Telelocator Staff](/wiki/Telelocator_Staff "Telelocator Staff") and [Life Giving Amulet](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet") with more runes are included, along with what may be a journal page. In the source code, there is ASCII art of [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell").

The journal page reads:

:   *A terrible form took shape in the air above the ritual last night! It was large and indistinct, but its countenance was infused with a sort of alien malevolence that chilled me to my very core. My fear was so great that I almost faltered in my incantations.*

:   *It made no hostile motions, however and after having hung in the aether for a time, it shivered out of existence. What was it? Was it observing me? Is it the guardian of some deeper secret to which I am drawing closer? In any event, I am not keen to meet its like again.*

Along with the description is a drawing of a [Terrorbeak](/wiki/Shadow_Creature#Terrorbeak "Shadow Creature").

The ad requisition reads:

:   *San Francisco Call Classified Advertisement Requisition*

:   *To appear in the [X] early [X] late edition(s)*
:   *On the following days [X]M [X]T [X]W [X]Th [X]F [X]Wk*
:   *Starting on June 6th, 1905*
:   *In the category of Employment Opportunities*

:   *Copy (2 cents per word per edition):*
:   *Looking to hire a lady assistant for a magician's stage show. Previous experience unnecessary, but should have a curious demeanor and a keen interest in the mysteries of the universe. Must provide own costume.*

:   *Contact information:*
:   *William Carter*
:   *c/o Palace Hotel,*
:   *San Francisco, California*

"William Carter" is smudged, as if someone tried to erase it. *[The San Francisco Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_San_Francisco_Call "wikipedia:The San Francisco Call")* was a real life publication in California. The [Palace Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_Hotel "wikipedia:Palace Hotel") is a luxury hotel in San Francisco, which was highly renowned in William's time, and was later gutted by fires after the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake. The page with the Telelocator Staff and Life Giving Amulet appears to be from the same book as the obelisk blueprint. In the source code, there is ASCII art of Maxwell's head.

The name of the file was "hey-maxy.jpg"

 

## Sixth puzzle[]

[The sixth puzzle](https://web.archive.org/web/20130913011244/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/6/charlie.html) shows a poster of Maxwell and his assistant, along with a handwritten note.

The poster reads:

:   *THE AMAZING MAXWELL*

:   *PERFORMING FEATS TO ASTOUND AND MYSTIFY*

The note reads:

:   *Hey Maxy,*

:   *We really knocked 'em dead last night, didn't we? I thought that old guy in the front wasn't going to make it. Those shadow things are so convincing - they almost scare me, and I'm part of the act!*

:   *We can work on the new finale when I get back from my [sister's](/wiki/Winona "Winona") place. I'm looking forward to it!*

:   *~ Charlie ♥*

In the source code, there is ASCII art of the Shadow Watcher.

## Seventh puzzle[]

[The seventh puzzle](https://web.archive.org/web/20131108160032/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/7/the-final-act.html) shows a dim room with a small light bulb. Here, a poster of Maxwell and the circus from previous clues are shown. The right half of the Maxwell poster is torn, meaning that the room is shown after the events of the eighth puzzle. There are also a few journal pages on the walls. In the source code is ASCII art of Maxwell.

Editing the image shows that there are hidden words etched into the walls of the room. The words include *devinctionibus*, *magicae*, *pretiositas*, *insaniam*, *alucinatio*, *voces*, and *tenebris* - these are Latin for "incantation", "magic", "value" or "cost", "insanity" or "madness", "illusion", "voices", and "darkness" respectively. Each word is accompanied by a corresponding symbol, which were later used to help decode the runes in the [Metheus Puzzles](/wiki/Metheus_Puzzles "Metheus Puzzles"). There are also some words in English: *Enough!*, *it's them*, and *Charlie*. *Charlie* is written three times, and gets increasingly larger.

## Eighth puzzle[]

[The eighth puzzle](https://web.archive.org/web/20140420213603/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/ta-da/praecantator.html) consists of a sequence of images that portray a scene where Charlie visits Maxwell's apartment. At the top of the images are tally marks indicating the order of the images. The portrait in the foreground above Maxwell's desk also changes across every picture.

Charlie's letter to Maxwell from the eleventh image's source code.

The text of Charlie's letter to Maxwell in the source code for the eleventh image reads:

:   *Max,*

:   *Where are you? I haven't heard from you in days! I stopped by your place, so I've got your props and costume for the show. I'll see you at the theatre tonight, I hope?*

:   *We need to talk about your... study room. There's some creepy stuff going on in there! Maybe when this run is over we can take a little break? My sister said we could use the family cabin up in BC if we want to get away.*

:   *XO,*
:   *Charlie*

If you go to the site code of the 12th picture, you will find pieces of paper. Each piece has Roman numerals. If you connect these pieces in the right order, you will see "one\_to\_ten". It is necessary to combine the name of all the pictures from one to ten and then you will get the link "[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809023257/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/max/process.phpe)". You will see the night monster page. If you enter an invalid phrase, it will say "You entered ...nothing happened." (It used to say "You typed \*your word \*. That is not correct answer! Try again")

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/e/e2/Disaster.png/revision/latest?cb=20131030215013 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/e/e2/Disaster.png/revision/latest?cb=20131030215013 

Image for the page that is linked to from the Shadow Watcher on the 13th image.

 

Clicking on the Shadow Watcher on the 13th image will take you to this [page](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111200428/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/max/stage/disaster.html). Clicking on the film reel will download a mod titled "[lost fragment](/wiki/The_Lost_Fragment "The Lost Fragment")". The mod allows the player to create a Shadow Portal and enter a new world with a biome similar to the one depicted in the epilogue for [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"). After activating the Shadow Portal, a [Skull Chest](/wiki/Skull_Chest "Skull Chest") will appear in the new world. Upon completing the mod, it will spawn a shadow [Phonograph](/wiki/Phonograph "Phonograph") which plays a message written in Morse code.

The Morse code, when translated, will give a password to the [page with night monster](https://web.archive.org/web/20180809023257/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/max/process.php) of the last puzzle update [here.](https://web.archive.org/web/20140108055712/http://www.dontstarvegame.com/science/mdocs/max/stage/1/grand-finale.html) The page features an embedded video entitled *[The Amazing Maxwell - The Final Act](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#The_Amazing_Maxwell_-_The_Final_Act "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*. *The Final Act* is an animated short in the style of a projector film reel, showing Maxwell's final performance, in which he loses control over the Codex Umbra. Suddenly, a pair of large Shadow Hands sprout from the book, ensnaring both Maxwell and Charlie. Before the camera cuts, they are shown being swung around violently.

The date and location of the final act alludes to the [1906 San Francisco Earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake "wikipedia:1906 San Francisco earthquake"), which is implied to have been caused by the Codex Umbra in-universe. This presumably explains the ramshackle appearance of Maxwell's apartment in the final two images of the original image sequence for this puzzle.

## Ninth puzzle[]

[The ninth puzzle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjYn6Qo9f_Y) marks the beginning of the next phase in the *Don't Starve* story. Two hidden words can be found in the first update trailer for *Don't Starve Together*. *Praecantator*, referring to the intermission after the last puzzle, is crossed out. This is followed shortly after by *Resumptus*, meaning "resumed" or "recovered".

The video features a transition from a world that is black and white and looks like the stage Maxwell and Charlie performed on in *The Final Act* to one that is filled with color and looks similar to the Constant. On the ground lies the [Codex Umbra](/wiki/Codex_Umbra "Codex Umbra"), as well as a red rose, resembling the one worn in Charlie's hair and on Maxwell's lapel.

### Third puzzle[]

Throughout the trailer for *Strange New Powers*, 25 frames will appear. These frames consist of a combinations of letters that individually mean nothing. If you do not pay attention to those combinations of letters that have already been before this trailer, then you can create a link at the beginning of which you need to sign ".html" and it will work (.html/nothingspecial). This led to the third puzzle.

### Eighth puzzle[]

In the *All's Well That Maxwell* update trailer, 25 frames will feature symbols, as well as numbers next to them. We need to illuminate the image from the seventh piece of the puzzle, then we will see that the decoding of the symbols was hidden in the dark areas of the picture. The numbers indicate which letters you need to take from the decoding of the character that stands next to it, if there are two numbers next to the character, then you need to take two letters. This must be done with all combinations of characters and numbers and then we get "praecantator". Turning this into a link gives us "/praecantator". This link led to the 8th piece of the puzzle.

### Ninth puzzle[]

In the trailer for *...In With The New* for the beta version of the game *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, you can see a few 25 frames. At the very beginning, the 25th frame (0:00:15) appears, the value of which is still unknown. In timecode 0:19, you can see frame 25 with the word "praecantator" crossed out, so we don't need it. At 0:57 timecode, the word "resumptus" can be found. This word would have to be inserted at the end of the web address of the then official *Don't Starve Together* page and would then have been "www.dontstarvetogether.com/resumptus", which refers to the ninth piece of the puzzle.

## PlaceholderTrivia[]

* The user who spotted the ninth puzzle was given the title of "Proelium" on the Klei Forums.
* Maxwell has a quote about the Bunnymen: "It reminds me of my old act". This is a reference to the times when he was still a man, a magician by profession.
* The first puzzle talks about Maxwell's serious health problems, which can explain his low amount of health.
* The postcard shows William's address: 21 Harold Street, New York. The return postcard contains Jack's address: 33 4th St., Corona, California.
