**“**Not a bad result considering the materials.**”**

–[Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona")

The **Engineering Tab** was a *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* exclusive tab that was only available to [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona").

As of the [March 2022 QoL update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together/Version_History#March_24,_2022_-_March_2022_QoL_Update "Don't Starve Together/Version History"), the Engineering Tab has been removed from *Don't Starve Together*. The items are now found under the [Survivor Items Filter](/wiki/Survivor_Items_Filter "Survivor Items Filter") as well as under item-specific [filters](/wiki/Filters "Filters").

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* A concept for a mechanized [Bernie](/wiki/Bernie "Bernie") structure for [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona") was shown during *Rhymes with Play* #228. It was part of an idea that Winona would provide upgrades to the other survivors' abilities, which was scrapped in favor of exclusive structures unique to Winona.
