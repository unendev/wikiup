**Krampus** (plural **Krampii**) is a neutral [Monster](/wiki/Monster "Monster") that steals items left on the ground. Krampus appears when overzealous hunters gain too much [naughtiness](#Naughtiness) from killing innocent creatures too fast.

It takes 3 blasts from the [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff") to freeze Krampus and 1 shot from a [Sleep Dart](/wiki/Sleep_Dart "Sleep Dart") to put him to sleep. When killed, Krampus will drop any stolen items, two pieces of [Charcoal](/wiki/Charcoal "Charcoal"), one [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat"), and, very rarely, his [Krampus Sack](/wiki/Krampus_Sack "Krampus Sack") (1% chance).

## Behavior[]

Krampus moves fairly fast and deals 50 damage per hit. He runs away when approached, similar to the behavior of a [Gobbler](/wiki/Gobbler "Gobbler") or [MacTusk](/wiki/MacTusk "MacTusk"). He will pick up most items laying on the ground in the player's vicinity. If there aren't any items left on the ground, he will hit items out of [Chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests") to steal them. He can also steal all types of [Backpacks](/wiki/Category:Backpacks "Category:Backpacks"), if he can't find any other items nearby. Krampus cannot break or steal from [Ice Boxes](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box"), [Drying Racks](/wiki/Drying_Rack "Drying Rack"), [Crock Pots](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") or most other structures that can hold items (other than normal Chests). He will keep running around the player until he has stolen a certain amount of items, then disappear into his sack.

Krampus will not steal the [Eye Bone](/wiki/Eye_Bone "Eye Bone"), [Lucy the Axe](/wiki/Lucy_the_Axe "Lucy the Axe"), [Willow's Lighter](/wiki/Willow%27s_Lighter "Willow's Lighter"), [Abigail's Flower](/wiki/Abigail%27s_Flower "Abigail's Flower"), [Pile o' Balloons](/wiki/Pile_o%27_Balloons "Pile o' Balloons"), [Divining Rod](/wiki/Divining_Rod "Divining Rod"), or [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing") components, unless these items are inside a Backpack.

## Naughtiness[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/0/05/Krampus Steal.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131111145402 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/0/05/Krampus Steal.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131111145402 

Two Krampii spawned at once. One is stealing an item with his sack.

 

Naughtiness is generated by killing certain creatures (either with a weapon or by "Murdering" them in the [inventory](/wiki/Inventory "Inventory")).
Once the player reaches a threshold of naughtiness (a random number between 31 and 50), Krampus will spawn. One Krampus can spawn before day 52, two or three starting on day 52, and three or four starting on day 102 (see [Bugs](#Bugs)), all counts being equally likely. After Krampus appears, the naughtiness level is reset to 0.

Each minute of restraint (⅛ of a day) reduces naughtiness by 1, meaning the player can reduce their naughtiness by 8 points by not attacking an innocent creature for one day. As the player gets closer to spawning Krampus, a hissing noise will be heard, warning the player every time innocent creatures are killed. The kill that spawns Krampus will not cause a hissing noise.

It is worth noting that setting creatures ablaze will *not* raise the player's naughtiness level. This is because the fire is considered to be the killing factor. The same goes for [Tooth Traps](/wiki/Tooth_Trap "Tooth Trap"), [Bee Mines](/wiki/Bee_Mine "Bee Mine"), [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder"), and [Slurtle Slime](/wiki/Slurtle_Slime "Slurtle Slime"), as they are all considered to be environmental damage. This is not to be confused with [cooking](/wiki/Cooking "Cooking") caught creatures over a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") or [Fire Pit](/wiki/Fire_Pit "Fire Pit") which does increase the naughtiness of the player and can earn a Krampus visit.

## Strategy[]

Krampus, especially when more than one spawns at the same time, can wreak havoc in a player's base without adequate preparation. Players are advised to pay attention to the signs of naughtiness, and only summon Krampus when preparations are complete; away from important items and the player's base. Krampus can be summoned by killing a number of passive creatures in quick succession. [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit") can be collected with [Traps](/wiki/Trap "Trap") then "murdered" in the inventory. [Birds](/wiki/Birds "Birds") can be summoned using a [Feather Hat](/wiki/Feather_Hat "Feather Hat"), then either captured and murdered by [Bird Traps](/wiki/Bird_Trap "Bird Trap") or directly killed using a [Boomerang](/wiki/Boomerang "Boomerang").

Krampus can be kited, a process by which the player attacks, moves away to avoid an attack, then attacks again. It is possible to strike Krampus one time in between attacks. Krampus' high melee damage and tendency to avoid the player makes him difficult to deal with using melee weapons. However, his low health makes ranged weapons, especially [Blow Darts](/wiki/Blow_Dart "Blow Dart"), effective. If melee is the only option, players should wear [Armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor") and use high damage weapons such as a [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword") or [Ham Bat](/wiki/Ham_Bat "Ham Bat") to avoid significant health loss. He can also be put to sleep or frozen, to make him an easy target. Placing a number of easily obtainable items such as single pieces of [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs"), [Cut Grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass") or [Pine Cones](/wiki/Pine_Cone "Pine Cone") will keep the Krampii occupied allowing the player to close enter melee range. Since Krampus is considered a monster, [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") and [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") are aggressive towards Krampus by default, so [Pig Villages](/wiki/Pig_Village "Pig Village") or [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") Villages can be utilized to kill Krampus.

## Downloadable Content[]

In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, killing [Glommer](/wiki/Glommer "Glommer") will immediately summon Krampii as it increases naughtiness by 50 points, the exact amount needed to spawn Krampus. Krampus also cannot steal from or break [Scaled Chests](/wiki/Scaled_Chest "Scaled Chest").

In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC, Krampus will be wearing a [Floral Shirt](/wiki/Floral_Shirt "Floral Shirt") on his visit to the islands. Also, killing the Seal form of [Sealnado](/wiki/Sealnado "Sealnado") will summon Krampus immediately. Eating [Shark Fin Soup](/wiki/Shark_Fin_Soup "Shark Fin Soup") adds 10 points of naughtiness, which can also be used to summon Krampus. Killing [Doydoys](/wiki/Doydoy "Doydoy") adds progressively more naughtiness as there are fewer Doydoys in the world. Killing the last two Doydoys will guarantee a Krampus spawn each. However, this is not recommended as such a process makes it impossible to breed more Doydoys later. This can be circumvented by bringing two Doydoys to the [Volcano](/wiki/Volcano/Biome "Volcano/Biome"), as it is considered a separate world, or by collecting enough materials to fabricate 2 Doydoy Nests + having a minimum of 2 Doydoy Eggs: so, despite killing the last two Doydoys remaining alive, the player can repopulate the island when placing the eggs in the empty nest.

As Krampus cannot spawn on the [Ocean](/wiki/Ocean#Shipwrecked "Ocean"), he will not appear immediately if the player is at sea while exceeding the naughtiness threshold. This delay also applies if the player kills an innocent creature on land using a ranged weapon from a [Boat](/wiki/Boats "Boats"), i.e. a [Boat Cannon](/wiki/Boat_Cannon "Boat Cannon"). Krampus will then spawn once the player kills the next creature while on land. Entering the Volcano at the peak of the naughtiness threshold will also cause it to spawn instantly. His inability to spawn at sea also means he cannot break or steal items from [Sea Chests](/wiki/Sea_Chest "Sea Chest").

In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")* DLC, Krampus has the ability to enter [interiors](/wiki/Category:Interiors "Category:Interiors"). However, he cannot break or steal items from [Cork Barrels](/wiki/Cork_Barrel "Cork Barrel") and [Root Trunks](/wiki/Root_Trunk "Root Trunk"). [Royal Guards](/wiki/Royal_Guard "Royal Guard") also do not attack Krampus, so the player will receive no help from them. Krampus can also spawn from stealing items from [Pig Shops](/wiki/Pig_Shops "Pig Shops").

## Don't Starve Together Don't Starve Together[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, naughtiness is calculated individually for each player. While Krampus spawns in the vicinity of the naughty player, anyone near them will also hear the warning hisses. In *[A New Reign](/wiki/A_New_Reign "A New Reign")*, 2 Krampii *per player engaging in the fight* will be summoned by [Klaus](/wiki/Klaus "Klaus") when his health drops to 50%, up to a maximum of 6 Krampii.

## Tips[]

* Summoning Krampus at night will summon sleeping Krampii, including during a [Full Moon](/wiki/Full_Moon "Full Moon"), which allows them to be easily killed. This can be combined with picking [Glommer's Flower](/wiki/Glommer%27s_Flower "Glommer's Flower"), which only spawns during Full Moons. Killing Glommer, which follows its flower, guarantees a Krampus spawn.
* [Tooth Traps](/wiki/Tooth_Trap "Tooth Trap") are not very effective against Krampus since there is a chance that he will steal the trap instead of activating it.
* Various forms of "Krampus traps" can be created utilizing their behavior of stealing items:
  + Placing a Chest with dummy items surrounded by Bee Mines.
  + Placing a Chest full of Killer Bees.
  + Placing a Chest and attacking him while he is busy stealing the dummy items.
* A [Frog](/wiki/Frog "Frog")'s tongue attack will make Krampus drop stolen items (if they do not kill him outright).
* The Krampus Sack does not burn, but all other drops will be turned to ash if Krampus dies from fire damage.
* In the *Shipwrecked* DLC, Krampii can be lured to their death by placing a [Coconade](/wiki/Coconade "Coconade") on the ground and lighting its fuse. Krampii will attempt to steal the Coconade, which can explode near them or in their inventory after they steal it, instantly killing them.

## Trivia[]

* Krampus was added in the *[Naughty and Nice](/wiki/Version_History#December_11.2C_2012_.E2.80.93_Naughty_and_Nice.5B14.5D.5B15.5D "Version History")* update.
* https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/6c/Old Krampus.png/revision/latest?cb=20161224213605 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/6c/Old Krampus.png/revision/latest?cb=20161224213605 

  Older version of Krampus.

   Before the *[Six Feet Under](/wiki/New_Features#October_1.2C_2013_-_Six_Feet_Under "New Features")* update, Krampus' eyes and "mouth" were originally yellow-green with side-way slit pupils. After said update, he was given a new look. He was re-textured with completely white eyes and a purple "mouth".
  + Despite this, however, Krampus's icon for the [World Customization](/wiki/World_Customization "World Customization") remains unchanged.
* According to the world customization screen and the code in kramped.lua, the plural of Krampus is "Krampii". This name is used when calculating how many should spawn at the same time.
* [Krampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus "wikipedia:Krampus") is a beast-like creature from the folklore of Alpine countries, thought to punish bad children during the Yule season by whipping them into submission. Krampus is said to capture particularly naughty children in his sack and carry them to his lair. Krampus' contrast to Saint Nicholas is reinforced by the [Charcoal](/wiki/Charcoal "Charcoal") he carries. Traditionally, naughty children are punished with coal in their stockings.
  + Krampus might also have some references to the Scandinavian [Yule Goat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule_Goat "wikipedia:Yule Goat"), an old pagan tradition originating from Norse mythology. Note that Krampus' horns resemble ones of an ornamental straw goat and in Finnish tradition, young men used to wear goat heads made out of straw (notice the Krampus' figure) in the Yule season, while going house to house demanding food and alcohol. [The Finnish version of Santa Claus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joulupukki "wikipedia:Joulupukki") still has the name of the Yule Goat.
  + Krampus also appears similar to reports of the [Jersey Devil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Devil "wikipedia:Jersey Devil"), a winged, red horse-like cryptid with horns. However, Krampus has no wings and a much thicker tail than a horse, more like a kangaroo or lizard. He also fights similar to a kangaroo's "kickboxing", standing on its tail and kicking with both feet.
* In the older versions of *Shipwrecked* DLC before the *[Home Sea Home](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked#November_21st,_2017_-_Home_Sea_Home_Update "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* update, Krampus appeared to have four arms, two carrying his sack and two sticking out from his sides.
* The Krampus [Profile Icon](/wiki/Profile_Icons "Profile Icons") in *Don't Starve Together* includes the flavor text "The Krampus is compelled to visit all naughty denizens of [The Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant")."
* Krampus plays a key role in the animated short *Possessions* that introduced the DLC character [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox") in *Don't Starve Together*, where Wortox absorbs the soul of the Krampus whom he accompanied after he went too far with his abuse of other creatures, becoming half-imp, half-Krampus himself.
  + Compared to the Krampii that appear in the game, the Krampus in *Possessions* has yellow eyes, and a black dog-like nose, he also appears to be more malicious and abusive than other Krampii, first stealing things from the characters unprovoked, spitefully popping Wes’ balloons to startle him and even going as far as steal a baby [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo"), which is what caused Wortox to snap at him.

## Bugs[]

* In the base game and the *Reign of Giants* DLC, there is a bug in the code that prevents the day 102 scale up from happening, so the number of Krampii spawned will not exceed 3. This bug is fixed in the *Shipwrecked* DLC and in *Don't Starve Together*, correctly spawning up to 4 Krampii from day 102 onwards. The fix will be effective in any *Shipwrecked* compatible worlds.
* Hitting Krampus as he jumps into his sack will cause him to reappear and become invincible. Krampus will not be able to move and cannot be killed (he can still be frozen and put to sleep like normal).
* Sometimes, two Krampii can spawn at the same time. This only occurs before day 5.
* In *Don't Starve Together*, relogging or traveling between the [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") and [Surface World](/wiki/Surface_World "Surface World") will reset the player's naughtiness level to 0, and create a new naughtiness threshold. In *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")*, both the naughtiness level and threshold will save, but the restraint timer will reset to 60 seconds.
