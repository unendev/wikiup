* Improved mod caching functionality. Mods are now cached during the updating as well as when temporarily downloading them on joining servers.
* The mod version\_compatible specified in the mods modinfo.lua, will now allow clients to run the latest mod from the Workshop and the server be on an older version if the modder has setup the mod to be compatible between the two versions.

## **November 18, 2015 - Integration of Caves Beta**[]

Rev. 157080

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/6b/DST Caves Live.png/revision/latest?cb=20171117012712 



 

**Changes**

* Now, you can have worlds consisting of more than one layer! One of those layers is the Caves preset, full of spelunking goodness.
  + However, caves currently can only be hosted on dedicated servers. Thankfully, we've made an option to launch an Overworld and Caves dedicated server with almost no configuration. [Preconfigured Server instructions can be found here](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/59171-hosting-caves-with-the-preconfigured-servers/).
  + If you'd rather configure the dedicated servers yourself: [Detailed dedicated server instructions can be found here](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://forums.kleientertainment.com/topic/59174-understanding-shards-and-migration-portals/).
* Caves look a little different than in Don't Starve. The layout is different, mushroom forests abound, and the sinkholes have gotten much larger.
* As well, the ruins have found their way up to the same level as the caves. So be warned as you are wandering around in the dark! You might just find yourself in a nightmare…
* Many items and objects in the game have undergone some tweaks and changes, especially things found in the caves. So pay attention!
* As well, dozens of existing bugs have been fixed! Yay! But we probably added lots of new ones too. That's how it goes!

**Some other things to be aware of**

* Now when you make a server you pick an "intention" for it. This is to help players joining your server for the first time understand what kind of gameplay you're expecting on your server.
* If a direct connection can't be established to a server, the game can use NAT Traversal. This means it's easier to set up a server, with no need to mess with router settings.
* Official Steam Controller support is in, and several small tweaks and improvements to controllers have been made.
* There is now a dedicated server for OSX. This is especially important so that Mac users can run their own caves.

## **April 21, 2015 - Integration of Reign of Giants Beta**[]

Rev. 134480

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/aa/DST RoG Addition.png/revision/latest?cb=20170805123146 



 

**Changes**

* Wigfrid is a playable character who is a stage actress. She went a bit too deep into method acting for her latest role, an ancient Valkyrie. She only eats meat and excels in battle.
* Webber is a playable character who is a young boy. Specifically, he’s a young boy who lives inside of the spider who tried to eat him long ago. He’s a monster who has learned some tricks from his arachnid encasement.
* Spring is a new season that brings heavy rains. With the rain comes more active flora and more aggressive fauna.
* Summer is a new season that brings a blistering heat wave. Plants will shrivel and you will too if you don’t keep cool. Oh, and the season previously known as Summer will be henceforth known as Autumn.
* Two new biomes: the Desert and the Deciduous Forest. Both are filled with new creatures, plants and gatherables. As with most things in Don’t Starve Together, they’ll help you survive. Or maybe kill you.
* Giants for every season! Deerclops isn’t the only big bad lurking out there, now.
* Rabbits and other small creatures that can go in your inventory need food too! You can feed them to keep them alive, but if you lock a rabbit in a box and leave it there for days, it’ll starve and turn into meat. And then rot. Yuck.
* Food left on crockpots and on drying racks will start spoiling before you collect it. They would previously last forever until harvested.
* If you don’t have any gear that protects you from the rain (there’s some new things for that!), the rain will make your character wet. If they get wet enough, they’ll start cooling down and losing sanity. Previously, the rain would directly make you lose sanity.
* Structures with wood in them can burn. You can hammer down the burnt husk to get some resources back.
* Fire propagation has been reworked. It’s still a menace, but it spreads more slowly, so you’ll have some chance to fight fires. There’s even water balloons to help with this!.
* The Ice Flingomatic has an emergency mode instead of being turned completely off. If it detects a few things burning down in quick succession, it’ll activate and try to save what it can.
* Giants are generally more present in the world, rather than jerks who come down from the proverbial hills to harass one unlucky player per season.
* The color of a Thermal Stone is now based on its temperature relative to the ambient temperature of the world, rather than having fixed temperatures at which its visuals change.
* It should also be a bit more effective at heating and cooling.
