## https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/40/Map Icon Florid Postern.png/revision/latest?cb=20180903223451 Removal[]

In the [February 7th, 2019 update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet#February_7th,_2019 "Don't Starve: Hamlet") of *Hamlet's* Early Access, Warbucks was removed from the game, making him unplayable for any new *Hamlet*-enabled world. His files were kept in the game as a "Retired" character, and pre-existing saves with him would not change. This was also done with the intention of allowing players to use Warbucks with the help of [mods](/wiki/Mods "Mods") or with [console](/wiki/Console "Console") commands.[[1]](#cite_note-joe1-1)

In the update post on the forums, [Klei Entertainment](/wiki/Klei_Entertainment "Klei Entertainment") gave their reasoning for removing him:

> "We weren't very happy with how Warbucks was working out. While trying to find ways to make him work, we decided that he just wasn't as interesting as we would like, and so we've made the decision to start from scratch with [a new character](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood")."[[2]](#cite_note-2)

The reason for his removal was later clarified:

> "Ultimately we felt Warbucks was both culturally problematic and not also very interesting to play so we decided to start over. We understand some people may like aspects of him, and perhaps we will bring some of those aspects back one day. In the meantime, we've decided to move on."[[1]](#cite_note-joe1-1)

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* In the *Hamlet* beta, Warbucks could be "unlocked" by selecting a new game slot and clicking on either the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* option or the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* option. Warbucks could be selected from the character selection screen. The player would hit apply for Warbucks, then go back and click on the *Hamlet* option. Warbucks would remain applied and the player can start a *Hamlet* world as Warbucks.
* Warbucks' voice was played by a bugle.[[3]](#cite_note-3)
* When Warbucks entered combat, his voice played to a tune similar to the finale of the *[1812 Overture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1812_Overture "wikipedia:1812 Overture")* by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. He was the only playable character with a unique battle cry.
* In the *Hamlet* beta, Warbucks had a base sanity of 300. This was changed to 200 in the early access release, likely for it to be more manageable.
* His title in the *Hamlet* beta was "The Gentleman Hunter". It was changed to "The Affluent Explorer" in the Early Access for *Hamlet*.
* In a developer stream by Klei, it was said that some inspirations for his character included Van Pelt from *Jumanji* and Professor Archimedes Q. Porter from Disney's *Tarzan*.
* In Art Stream #46, an unimplemented alternate design of Warbucks' character portrait was seen being used as a reference. A Shovel replaced the Blunderbuss, and he wore a smile.
* Warbucks can be unlocked by typing the following command in the console in main menu: `RETIRED_CHARACTERLIST = {}` *Note that when the game is closed, Warbucks will become hidden again and in order to create a new world with him, the command must be used again.*

### Lore[]

* When he examines the [Alchemy Engine](/wiki/Alchemy_Engine "Alchemy Engine"), he says: "I've dabbled in a bit of alchemy from time to time." This could mean that he was once an alchemist.
* Warbucks says: "Reminds me of my regimental band." when he examines [One-man Band](/wiki/One-man_Band "One-man Band"). He also says: "I prefer a robust military march." when [Maxwell's Phonograph](/wiki/Gramaphone "Gramaphone") is examined. This may indicate that he participated in the regimental band.
