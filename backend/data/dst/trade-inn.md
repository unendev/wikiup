The Trade Inn interface.

 

The **Trade Inn** (or Trade INN) is a feature exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. It is used to trade in multiple common [Skins](/wiki/Skins "Skins") for rarer ones. The machine works by taking nine items of the same tier and giving the player a single skin a tier higher. However, there is a rare chance of the machine giving out a rarer skin that is two, three, or even four tiers higher (capped at **Elegant**).

The mysterious Curio Collector.

 

The Trade Inn is run by the Curio Collector, a mysterious, elderly, seemingly veteran survivor of the [Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant") who wears a thick Beefalo fur coat and speaks in a heavy southern accent.

### *Ravin' Wrapper Raiders*[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/0/02/Curio Collector Mini Game.png/revision/latest?cb=20191029194528 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/0/02/Curio Collector Mini Game.png/revision/latest?cb=20191029194528 



 

**“**I've done witnessed a murder! And they're stealin' all my hard-earned candy wrappers!**”**

–[Curio Collector](/wiki/Curio_Collector "Curio Collector")

***Ravin' Wrapper Raiders*** is a minigame added to the Trade Inn during the *[Hallowed Nights](/wiki/Hallowed_Nights "Hallowed Nights")* 2019 event. Players can enter the game by clicking on the crow. The usual Trade Inn interface changes to an 8 x 5 grid with tiles containing a random assortment of candy wrappers and at least one crow. The premise of the game is that the crows have stolen the Curio Collector's candy wrapper collection and it is up to the player to help him scare the crows away.

The game is a tile-matching puzzle similar to *[SameGame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame "wikipedia:SameGame")* wherein the player clears groups of adjoining tiles by clicking on them. Clearing tiles close to crows causes the birds to flee. More wrappers and crows fall from the top of the game screen to replace the cleared tiles. The player can equip 5 different tools from a row of buttons at the bottom of the Trade Inn interface. These tools have different effects to help clear tiles. The game starts with 3 of each tool available. Clearing 10 or more tiles at a time will earn the player a bonus tool from the Curio Collector. The game ends when there are no more possible moves and all tools are used up.

Completing the game with a certain amount of points will reward the player with the Curio Collector [Profile Icon](/wiki/Profile_Icons#Other "Profile Icons").

### *A Feastin' Pair of Birds*[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/47/Afeastinpairofbirds.png/revision/latest?cb=20191214023912 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/47/Afeastinpairofbirds.png/revision/latest?cb=20191214023912 



 

**“**Let's play a game! Use that big brain to match pairs of food from the feast!**”**

***A Feastin' Pair of Birds*** is a minigame added during the *[Winter's Feast](/wiki/Winter%27s_Feast "Winter's Feast")* 2019 event. To access the game, the player must click on the Snowbird on the top left of the Trade Inn interface. Similar to usual mix and match memory games, the game requires the player to memorize the tiles and match them correctly. When a match is created, two tiles fall into the 3 x 2 grid, showing the tiles until the player skips, then flipping over. The game ends when/if the player runs out of their 3 starting guesses. There are only 5 types of tiles to ensure that there is always at least one match. If two Snow bird tiles are cleared, the player will gain an additional guess. The goal of the game is to get the highest score.

If the player gets a score of 10 or more matches, they will be rewarded with a Snowbird Profile Icon.

### *An Eggy Tally*[]

***An Eggy Tally*** is a minigame that was added as part of the *[Troubled Waters](/wiki/Return_of_Them#Troubled_Waters "Return of Them")* update. Players can start the game by clicking on the [Redbird](/wiki/Redbird "Redbird") in the Trade Inn interface. The game is a timed mental-math puzzle in which numbers in vertically/horizontally adjacent squares can be additionally combined with the goal of making as many 100's as possible. When a 100 is formed, the square containing that 100 is permanently replaced by a fresh egg (if the 100 was created before the timer ran out) or a rotten egg (if the 100 was created after the timer ran out); however, the egg will remain on the board, permanently occupying its square and gradually increasing the difficulty of forming future 100's. The game will not allow any squares to go beyond 100 in value. The game ends when there are no possible number combinations left on the board.

If the player gets a rotten egg on the board, they will be rewarded with a Rotten Egg Profile Icon.

If the player gets 6 or more fresh eggs on the board, they will be rewarded with a Egg Profile Icon.

If the player gets 12 or more fresh eggs on the board, they will be rewarded with a Redbird Profile Icon.

### *A Mess of a Maze*[]

***A Mess of a Maze*** is a minigame that was added as part of the *[Midsummer Cawnival](/wiki/Midsummer_Cawnival "Midsummer Cawnival")* event. Players access the game by clicking on the [Crow Kid](/wiki/Midsummer_Cawnival#Crow_Kid "Midsummer Cawnival") located in the bottom-left of the Trade Inn interface.

The player will be rewarded with a Crow Kid Profile Icon at 25 pieces of junk collected and a Corvus Goodfeather Profile Icon upon collecting all 100 pieces of junk.

### *Collar Me Impressed*[]

***Collar Me Impressed***[[1]](#cite_note-1) is a minigame added as part of the *[Year of the Catcoon](/wiki/Year_of_the_Catcoon "Year of the Catcoon")* event. Players can access this minigame by clicking on the [Kitcoon](/wiki/Kitcoon "Kitcoon") collar in the top-right of the Trade Inn interface. When a player clicks on the collar for the first time they are asked to provide a name for their own Kitcoon. Upon entering a name, the player is taken to a screen with a Kitcoon in a forest that the player can take care of. The Kitcoon's color pattern and appearance can be one of the nine different patterns of [Kitcoons](/wiki/Kitcoon "Kitcoon") found in the regular game. The Kitcoon's starting age can also vary between the range of 5-10 days.[[2]](#cite_note-Antonio32A-post-2) After spawning in, its age increases in real time.

Players can interact with their Kitcoon in three ways: They can feed their Kitcoon by clicking on the bag with the fish treat icon found to the left of the Kitcoon, they can pet their Kitcoon by clicking it, and they can put it in hibernation, by clicking on the little kitcoon den to the right.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/e/e2/Kitcoon max size Antonio32A-shot.png/revision/latest?cb=20220325045910 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/e/e2/Kitcoon max size Antonio32A-shot.png/revision/latest?cb=20220325045910 

A Kitcoon at its maximum size

 

Kitcoons start at a Size value of 30 units, and the player can grow the Kitcoon by playing with it and feeding it every 50 hours. After ten sets of interactions (500 hours minimum), the Kitcoon can eventually grow to its maximum size of 120 units.[[2]](#cite_note-Antonio32A-post-2)

Kitcoons have a Hungeriness value that can range between 0 and 100. All new Kitcoons start with 30 hunger, and feeding the Kitcoon reduces its hunger by 15. Hunger is increased by 1 for every hour that the player is away. Upon reaching 0 hunger, the Kitcoon will lick itself.[[2]](#cite_note-Antonio32A-post-2)

Kitcoons also have a Happiness value that can range between 0 and 100. All new Kitcoons start with a Happiness value of 70, and playing with the Kitcoon increases its Happiness by 15. However, for every hour that the player is away from the Kitcoon its Happiness reduces by 1. Reaching maximum hunger immediately reduces the Kitcoon's Happiness to 0. When at full Happiness, the Kitcoon will perform a small walking/playing animation. Reaching 15 or less Happiness with a Hunger of over 85 will cause the kitten to become sad and play a distressed animation. In contrast, though, if the Kitcoon's Hunger is under 5 and its Happiness is over 95, the Kitcoon will stretch its legs and fall asleep; while in this state, the player won't be able to interact with the Kitcoon until it wakes up some time later or wakes up from hibernation.[[2]](#cite_note-Antonio32A-post-2)

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/10/Collar Me Impressed Kitcoon poop.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220214234809 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/10/Collar Me Impressed Kitcoon poop.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220214234809 

Uncleaned poop littering the ground after the Kitcoon has been left alone for a time.

 

Poop will also begin spawning after every hour that the Kitcoon is left alone. The number of poop piles spawned each hour is equal to the number of hours away divided by 4. (With any decimals dropped.) The player can clean up any piece of poop by clicking on it, and if they exit the Kitcoon game with any piles still present, the Kitcoon's Happiness decreases by 0.12 times the number of poop piles.[[2]](#cite_note-Antonio32A-post-2)

After starting the minigame, the Kitcoon has a 40% chance to appear in one of the four corners of the Player's screen whenever they visit the Main Menu, the [Curio Cabinet](/wiki/Curio_Cabinet "Curio Cabinet"), the [Treasury](/wiki/Treasury "Treasury"), the [Server settings](/wiki/World_Customization "World Customization"), the [Wardrobe](/wiki/Wardrobe "Wardrobe"), the [Morgue](/wiki/Morgue "Morgue"), the [Compendium](/wiki/Compendium "Compendium"), the Server Selection screen, the Mystery Box redemption screen, or the the Character Bio screen.[[2]](#cite_note-Antonio32A-post-2)

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/e/e8/Kitcoon abandonmessage.png/revision/latest?cb=20220212231235 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/e/e8/Kitcoon abandonmessage.png/revision/latest?cb=20220212231235 



 

If a Kitcoon's Happiness reaches 0 (which would occur after 100 hours if the player left the Kitcoon with full Happiness), then the next time the player goes to check on the Kitcoon, they will be greeted with the message "[Cat Name] has abandoned you." along with an explanation as to why the Kitcoon has left. After this message the minigame resets and the player may adopt another randomized Kitcoon from the beginning.[[2]](#cite_note-Antonio32A-post-2)

To preserve a Kitcoon at its current stats, the player can put it in hibernation.
