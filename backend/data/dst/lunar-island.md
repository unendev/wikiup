## Lunar Island

Lunar Island

**“**Something about this place has made the creature go quite wrong.**”**

–[Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom"), when examining a Moonrock Pengull.

The **Lunar Island** is a unique area exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, introduced in *[Return of Them](/wiki/Return_of_Them "Return of Them")*. It is a remote island originating from a chunk of the [Moon](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle") (or more precisely, the [Alter](/wiki/Alter "Alter")) located far out into the [Ocean](/wiki/Ocean "Ocean") and accessible only by [Boat](/wiki/Boat_Kit "Boat Kit"), [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie")'s Weregoose form, or rarely, the [Telelocator Staff](/wiki/Telelocator_Staff "Telelocator Staff")'s random teleport. The Lunar Island's landing has increased the sea level of the Ocean near [The Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant")'s mainland in *Don't Starve Together*, making it sailable.

As soon as the player steps onto the island, a special effect will apply that replaces the player's [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") with an [Enlightenment](/wiki/Enlightenment "Enlightenment") meter. The Enlightenment meter rises at the same rate as Sanity decreases outside the island.

The Lunar Island consists of five different [Biomes](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes"):

* The [Rocky Beach](/wiki/Rocky_Beach "Rocky Beach") is inhabited by [Anenemies](/wiki/Anenemy "Anenemy") and contains [Reeds](/wiki/Reeds "Reeds") or [Shattered Spider Holes](/wiki/Shattered_Spider_Hole "Shattered Spider Hole").
* The [Lunar Archipelago](/wiki/Lunar_Archipelago "Lunar Archipelago") consists of multiple small islands containing [Sea Bones](/wiki/Sea_Bones "Sea Bones") and [Driftwood](/wiki/Driftwood "Driftwood").
* The [Lunar Forest](/wiki/Lunar_Forest "Lunar Forest") is mostly comprised of [Lune Trees](/wiki/Lune_Tree "Lune Tree") with some [Shattered Spider Holes](/wiki/Shattered_Spider_Hole "Shattered Spider Hole").
* The [Lunar Baths](/wiki/Lunar_Baths "Lunar Baths") biome is full of [Saladmanders](/wiki/Saladmander "Saladmander") and [Stone Fruit Bushes](/wiki/Stone_Fruit_Bush "Stone Fruit Bush").
* The [Lunar Mine](/wiki/Lunar_Mine "Lunar Mine") contains [Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder"), [Moon Glass](/wiki/Moon_Glass "Moon Glass"), multiple [Celestial Fissures](/wiki/Celestial_Fissure "Celestial Fissure"), and the [Inviting Formations](/wiki/Inviting_Formation "Inviting Formation").

[Gestalts](/wiki/Gestalt "Gestalt") can be found commonly on the island. When a [Hound](/wiki/Hound "Hound") is killed on the Lunar Island, it has a chance to become a [Horror Hound](/wiki/Horror_Hound "Horror Hound"). Aggressive [Moonrock Pengulls](/wiki/Moonrock_Pengull "Moonrock Pengull") will spawn on the island during the [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), like normal [Pengulls](/wiki/Pengull "Pengull") do on the mainland.

## Prototype Tips[]

* To find the Lunar Island, look for several explored biomes forming a large bay or 'C' shape together around open water. The location of Lunar Island tries to turn that 'C' into an 'O'.
* There are no [Sea Stacks](/wiki/Sea_Stack "Sea Stack") or deep water on the shortest routes between the main island and the Lunar Island.
* Woodie's [Weregoose](/wiki/Cursed_Woodie "Cursed Woodie") form is a great option for finding the Lunar Island so long as you don't transform back to Woodie over water (exploring on day 11 gives you much more time as a goose due to the full moon).
* When playing as [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox"), planting [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") at the Lunar Island, and then farming the resulting [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterfly "Butterfly") for their drops is a good way to keep Wortox fed and lower Enlightenment while on the island.
* Utilizing the Lunar Baths, the Lunar Island is a good place to set up camp in Winter, as the nights are long, which can keep Enlightenment low, and the [Hot Springs](/wiki/Hot_Spring "Hot Spring") can provide players with both heat to combat freezing and light if [Bath Bombed](/wiki/Bath_Bomb "Bath Bomb"), just be aware of the Moon Cycle when the Springs are Bath Bombed otherwise they shall lose their sources of heat and light to the Springs turning to glass during the full moon.
  + [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang") can do quite well on the Lunar Island due to his faster sanity drain.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The Lunar Island was introduced in the *[Turn of Tides](/wiki/Return_of_Them#Turn_of_Tides "Return of Them")* update.
* The Lunar Island is a piece of [The Alter](/wiki/Them "Them")'s outer shell that broke off and fell into the Ocean. This event is shown in the [release trailer](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Return_of_Them:_Turn_of_Tides_Launch "Animated Shorts and Trailers") for *Turn Of Tides*. Despite being called that in game, it is not a piece of the moon, as there is no moon in [The Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant").
* Rarely, the Lunar Island will spawn so close to the land that Wortox's normal soul hop will be able to reach it.
* And, Even rarer, it can spawn attached to the mainland. It's probably not supposed to though.
