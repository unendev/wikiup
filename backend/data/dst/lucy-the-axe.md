**“**All work and no play makes  
me want to chop some trees.**”**

–**Lucy the Axe**

**Lucy the Axe** is a character-specific [Item](/wiki/Item "Item") that [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie") begins the game with. Lucy has infinite durability and increased effectiveness (one swing at tree is worth two "chops" of regular axe) and in Woodie's hands who has faster innate chopping animation, cuts [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree") extraordinarily fast. She can be used as a melee weapon, dealing half the damage of the regular [Axes](/wiki/Axe "Axe").

When equipped, Lucy will speak a line such as 'I missed you', 'Did you miss me?' and 'You came back!'. She speaks with red text that appears below Woodie, to avoid confusion with Woodie's white text, and is given a shrill, instrumental sound effect whenever her lines are spoken.

When not in the player's inventory, Lucy will be indicated on the map by an icon. This can be useful to indicate where the player's items were dropped at the point of a Werebeaver's transformation. She cannot be stolen by [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus"), [Splumonkeys](/wiki/Splumonkey "Splumonkey"), and [Prime Apes](/wiki/Prime_Ape "Prime Ape") or eaten by [Eyeplants](/wiki/Eyeplant "Eyeplant").

## Don't Starve Don't Starve[]

In *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")*, while Lucy eggs Woodie on when he chops down Trees, she will begin to warn Woodie when the transformation is almost ready to occur. Lucy can be destroyed if Woodie tries to attack the [Nightmare Throne](/wiki/Nightmare_Throne "Nightmare Throne") with her equipped.

–[Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda")

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, though she has received no changes in terms of use, Lucy did receive some minor tweaks. Other players cannot use or even hold Lucy, as she will just slip from their grasp. Even if she is spawned directly into their inventory she will just fall out onto the ground. In addition, if Woodie loses Lucy and is unable to retrieve her for any reason he can simply craft a normal Axe that will turn into Lucy as soon as he begins to chop a tree. If left on the ground for too long, Lucy will turn back into a regular axe.

Lucy can be destroyed by two [Meteor](/wiki/Meteor "Meteor") strikes.

In the [Skill Spotlight](/wiki/From_Beyond#Skill_Spotlight:_Wormwood,_Wolfgang,_Woodie "From Beyond") update, Lucy was given more utility. Using Lucy as one of the ingredients, Woodie is able to craft the [Hardwood Hat](/wiki/Hardwood_Hat "Hardwood Hat"), the [Wooden Walking Stick](/wiki/Wooden_Walking_Stick "Wooden Walking Stick"), and refine [Boards](/wiki/Boards "Boards") at a reduced cost (3 logs instead of 4). Lucy speaks when crafting these items, and a unique animation plays.

## Trivia[]

* Lucy is a sentient being, and although it's not known if this is real or just Woodie's imagination, this is likely the former, as in *Don't Starve Together*, others can see her quotes when they try to pick her from the ground.
* In appearance, Lucy is based on a traditional fire axe, having a red blade with a silver edge, and a wooden handle.
* Lucy is the first item that can speak and has distinct lines, not just sound effects, like the [Living Log](/wiki/Living_Log "Living Log")'s scream.
* Lucy does not appear to recognize Woodie when he is a ghost.
* Lucy is voiced by a musical saw.
* When playing Adventure Mode, Lucy will not use a slot in the Teleportato. She will appear in Woodie's inventory after arriving in the new world.
* Lucy's line, "All work and no play makes me want to chop trees", is a reference to the English proverb "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". This may also be a reference to the pivotal scene in the Stephen King film *[The Shining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(film) "wikipedia:The Shining (film)")*, where insane character Jack Torrance types this line many times, and later uses an axe similar to Lucy as a weapon.
* Lucy's line "You're the ghostest with the mostest." is a reference to the movie *Beetlejuice*.
* Kevin Forbes added Lucy for Woodie's special item because he "liked the idea of a half-crazed lumberjack being egged on by his axe."[[1]](#cite_note-beavertrivia-1)
* Based on his examination quote, Maxwell seems to have known Lucy beforehand.
* One of her quotes for Woodie changing back from the Werebeaver ("I think that creepy girl is mad at you.") is a complement to Wendy's quote for the Werebeaver. ("He pinky-promised I'd get to ride on his shoulders next time. Such lies.")
* Unlike in regular DST, other players can actually wield and throw Riled Lucy in the [Forge](/wiki/Forge "Forge"). However, she will not return to their hand if she is thrown, and will need to be manually picked up.
* Riled Lucy in the Forge does not talk. However, her speech files reveal that she has lines for various situations that were cut because the developers felt that they created too much clutter. [[2]](#cite_note-2)
* Klei wanted to make it so that a player who is not the owner of Lucy, if he decides to pick her up, would receive 5 units. damage. This is confirmed by the lines in the code, "LUCY\_BITE\_DAMAGE = 5, -- amount of damage done to non-woodies who equip lucy". Currently, when trying to "Take" it simply falls out of the inventory with exclamations.
* In the "[A Little Drama](/wiki/A_Little_Drama_and_QOL "A Little Drama and QOL")" update, Lucy recites the following poem when Woodie stands on the stage: "Chop chop chop, swing swing swing. Choppin' is my favourite thing. Swing swing swing, chop chop chop. Love it way too much to stop!" Only Woodie can see this text, and he comments "You've sure got a way with words, Luce."
