## March 26, 2013 - Doorway to Adventure[]

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/27/Doorway to Adventure.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130501213547

**New Features**

* Adventure mode is now integrated into survival mode. In a survival mode level, you can find a special portal that will take you to the start of adventure mode. If you die in adventure mode, you will wake up back in your survival level, outside of the portal. From there you can try again (restarting at level 1, of course). Dying in survival mode is still perma-death-fatal, and retrying a survival level will always generate a new one for you. Any existing saves that you might have from previous patches will be interpreted as survival levels - you should be able to teleport out of them to get access to the new features.
* New front-end screens for dealing with the save slots and the new game flow.
* The adventure levels have been re-done to better match what their final structure will be. They’re still a bit rough around the edges, but you can start to see the overall sweep of the game now. Please see the detailed descriptions at the end of the change list.

**New Craftables**

* [Healing Salve](/wiki/Healing_Salve "Healing Salve") - Made from crushed spider glands and ash - heals 20 health
* [Lightning Rod](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod") - Protects bases against lightning, gives you a night of free light when struck.
* [Heat Stone](/wiki/Heat_Stone "Heat Stone") - Place it near a fire to warm it up, and then carry it around with you to fend off the bitter frost.
* [Earmuffs](/wiki/Rabbit_Earmuffs "Rabbit Earmuffs") - Made from rabbits, of course!
* [Piggyback](/wiki/Piggyback "Piggyback") - A fancier, bigger backpack (that slows you down!)

**New Creatures**

* [The Bishop](/wiki/Clockwork_Bishop "Clockwork Bishop") - guards Maxwell’s structures with lightning shots

**New Level Features**

* Chess biome! In adventure levels, Maxwell's influence has begun creeping into the environment.
* Points of interest and traps - these are small, non-random areas that have good or bad effects.
* [Touch Stone](/wiki/Touch_Stone "Touch Stone") - these mysterious stones act as one-time-use meat effigies if you touch them. There are a handful generated in each survival level.
* [Maxwell's Door](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door") - leads to adventure mode.
* Pleasingly-arranged mushroom rings
* One-way "Sick" wormhole (only in adventure mode currently)
* [Pig-head-on-a-stick](/wiki/Pig_Head "Pig Head") - someone’s been busy!
* Variant [Berry Bush](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush")

**Tuning**

* Compressed the XP track. You now earn 20xp per survival mode day at a flat rate, and unlock all the XP-unlockable characters a lot more quickly
* Characters have a bit more health by default. This is to reduce the number of one-shot player deaths, and give you more of a chance to run away from danger.
* The player now has 15 inventory slots
* When you advance through the teleportato in adventure mode, you can only take four items with you. Choose wisely!
* Sanity depletion in the rain is less harsh
* The HUD is a bit smaller, to show more of the game world
* Removed low-level farm plots. We really didn’t need three versions of the same thing.
* Deerclops, lightning and beefalo mating season are configurable through level gen parameters
* Stepping on spider ground will trigger a response from the den
* Tweaked mushroom spawn chances
* Abigail has more health, but enemies will fight back against her

* Many new map icons, including backpacks and Chester!
* Crock-pot fixes: mushrooms count as vegetables, fixed frogglebunwich recipe
* You can no longer carry an extra backpack in your hands as you walk around.
* Werepigs don’t kite. They are too angry for that.
* The death screen buttons should always work now.
* RMB can be used to light things on fire when the torch is equipped (useful at night)
* Added a default start node so that Maxwell and Wilson not occluded
* Frozen ponds can't be fished anymore.. but you can walk across them.

**Level Descriptions:** The adventure levels are still being worked on and refined, but here's an idea of where the are right now and where we want them to be.

**Level 1:**

Near-constant rain and frequent short winters take a toll on your sanity and your fires. You must survive in these more extreme conditions as you hunt for the teleportato pieces. When complete, this level should feel similar to a survival level, but with increased pressure on all your resources.

**Level 2:**

This level is smaller and shorter than the previous level, but it is permanently winter! The aim is to survive the cold without any preparation time. When complete, this level should keep you moving quickly.

**Level 3:**

The level features a resource-rich central island, surrounded by dangerous lands containing each of the teleportato pieces. Right now it's still fairly lush, but eventually the outlying islands should be quite inhospitable!

**Level 4:**

Use the first land to stock up. Once you pass through the dying wormhole, you'll need everything you've got to survive. We're currently still working on the balance between the two lands.

**Level 5:**

This level should put your survival skills to the ultimate test, not only will there be harsh weather and tough monsters, but resources will be extremely scarce. Eventually. Right now it's just been roughed in, but it's still got lots of badguys in it!

**Level 6:**

Maxwell is still devising this level...

## February 26, 2013 - A Winter's Tale[]

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b0/A Winter%27s Tale.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130501213847

**Winter**
Winter comes every 20 days or so, with snow and a new audio landscape. Ambient air temperature is modelled, and your character will get colder the longer he/she stays out in the open. Getting too cold for too long will cause freezing damage. You can extend your time away from the fire by wearing warm clothing. Nights are longer, and vegetation does not replenish. Bees and butterflies don’t leave their houses in the winter.

**Improved Mod Support**
There is a new mod API that should make mods break less when we update, and allows multiple mods to work at the same time. Here is some documentation on **[how to create a mod](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/showthread.php?10817-TUTORIAL-Creating-a-Mod-using-the-Mod-System)**. Language packs are now actually supported. We supply a strings.pot template file with every update, and the game can load .po language files. This should make maintaining translations a lot easier, and you can use industry-standard tools. For more info, **[see here](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/showthread.php?10819-TUTORIAL-Creating-a-translation-using-the-PO-Format)**.

**New creatures:**

* [Mactusk N' Son](/wiki/Mactusk_N%27_Son "Mactusk N' Son") - Sets up camp in an igloo with his Son, and then hunt you with blowdarts and hounds.
* [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops") - He’s big, he likes to smash stuff, and he’s really hard to kill. You should probably just run away.
* [Winter Koalefant](/wiki/Winter_Koalefant "Winter Koalefant") - You can harvest his warm winter trunk.
* [Snowbird](/wiki/Snowbird "Snowbird") - A winter bird that drops a new type of feather.
* [Mosquito](/wiki/Mosquito "Mosquito") - Spawn from ponds or Maxwell's Mosquito Traps. They eat too much and explode!
* [Blue Hound](/wiki/Blue_Hound "Blue Hound") - Assists MacTusk N' Son with fighting and he has chance to drop Blue Gem

**New Drops**

* [Blue Gem](/wiki/Blue_Gem "Blue Gem")
* [Walrus Tusk](/wiki/Walrus_Tusk "Walrus Tusk")
* [Deerclops Eyeball](/wiki/Deerclops_Eyeball "Deerclops Eyeball")
* [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter")
* [Snowbird Feather](/wiki/Snowbird_Feather "Snowbird Feather")

**New Craftables**

* [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff")
* [Winterometer](/wiki/Winterometer "Winterometer")
* [Blow Dart](/wiki/Blow_Dart "Blow Dart") (damaging)
* [Puffy vest](/wiki/Puffy_Vest "Puffy Vest")

**Adventure Mode (continued)** This update continues the development of adventure mode, and seeks to refine the difficulty curve.

* Varying summer/winter lengths
* Varying day/night lengths
* New resource-starved worlds
* Island chain worlds with lots of [Worm Holes](/wiki/Worm_Hole "Worm Hole")

**Sandbox Mode (continued)** Added a new world creation screen. There are only a couple of options enabled currently, but soon you will be able to unlock more!
**Sanity tuning** From our testing, we determined that sanity was coming on too early for new players, but was also easily avoidable by established players. The intention is for sanity to be a long-term lurking danger, so this was the complete opposite of what we were going for. Here are some changes to help rectify this:

* [Vegetables](/wiki/Vegetables "Vegetables") , [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") foods don’t regen as much sanity
* [Monsters](/wiki/Monster "Monster") cause more sanity drain when near
* Player’s Initial [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") is higher
* Pure darkness causes a large drop [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") (instead of a gradient around a light source)
* [Shadowbeasts](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") show up later in the [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") curve, and are unattackable when you are not insane.
* The [Crawling Horror](/wiki/Shadow_Creature#Crawling_Horror "Shadow Creature") is weaker and the [Terrorbeak](/wiki/Shadow_Creature#Terrorbeak "Shadow Creature") is tougher
* [Charlie](/wiki/Grue "Grue") the invisible monster deals sanity damage when he hits you.
* The sanity effect jiggles more slowly, so as to be less nauseating.

**Tuning / Fixes**

* [Rabbit Traps](/wiki/Trap "Trap") work again
* [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(NPC) "Maxwell (NPC)") leaves traps for you in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode")
* Armor is less effective
* Player attacks are less powerful
* [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") can’t be stunlocked, have less windup animation before an attack, attack less often, have more health, take longer to respawn, and attempt to kite their targets
* [Bees](/wiki/Bee "Bee") run around between attacks
* [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") healing and health values adjusted
* Dead rabbits respawn slower
* [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") drop fewer meats
* [Honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey") doesn't heal as much
* Honey generates more slowly in bee boxes
* [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") have more [warriors](/wiki/Spider_Warrior "Spider Warrior"), and cycle through levels faster
* Spoilage is a bit faster in general
* Stale food has less of a hunger penalty
* Healing values are a bit lower in general
* Ponds show up in more places
* [Eye Bone](/wiki/Eye_Bone "Eye Bone") turns to ash during teleportation even if you hide them in a backpack
* [Teleportato](/wiki/Things "Things") pieces are more scattered, and have little setpiece scenes surrounding them
* [Pan Flute](/wiki/Pan_Flute "Pan Flute") require a [mandrake](/wiki/Mandrake "Mandrake") to craft
* Darts shouldn’t miss targets that are walking away
* More effective [Bush Hat](/wiki/Bush_Hat "Bush Hat")

### February 28, 2013 - Hotfix[]

**Balance:**

* Armor durability back to sanity-patch levels
* Player does 34 base damage instead of 33 (so as to not leave creatures with 1 health that requires an extra hit)
* [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig") kite like normal [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig")

**Features:**

* [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent") overhaul - acts as a multi-use [Straw Roll](/wiki/Straw_Roll "Straw Roll") (restores sanity, costs time and hunger)
* [Straw Roll](/wiki/Straw_Roll "Straw Roll") has a normal hunger penalty, not a percentage

**Fixes:**

* Translation fixes (some spelling fixes too)
* Possible fix for rare oncreep crash
* Highest campfire light level circle is larger than the second highest

### February 29, 2013 - Hotfix[]

* Fixed a crash on day 12 of Level 4 of [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") when the seasons change.

### February 13, 2013 - Hotfix[]

**New item:**

* [Garland](/wiki/Garland "Garland") - a pretty hat made out of flowers that gives a small sanity buff until it rots away

**Bug fixes:**

* Natural pig villages in new worlds won’t be too large
* Bird traps take longer to trap birds
* [Wall](/wiki/Wall "Wall") repair is cheaper
* Pigs say the right thing when they are befriended
* Pigs don’t eat things off ground right when they are spawned

* Wet goop does not restore sanity
* Sanity penalty for eating spoiled food is not as strong
* Reduced nightmarefuel crafting costs
* Reduced night light insanity aura

## February 12, 2013 – Insanity![]

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/34/Insanity%21.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130501214142

**New Character: [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes")** - Do you think Don’t Starve is too easy? Try playing as Wes, the mime! He’s not good at doing anything!

**[Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity")** - The player character loses sanity when he is left alone in the dark, gets close to scary monsters, or does crazy things like eating monster meat or jumping through a [Worm Hole](/wiki/Worm_Hole "Worm Hole"). Sanity can be regained through acts of dapperness, like wearing fancy clothes in the sunshine and eating candy.
Low sanity is not fatal, but strange creatures from another time and place are attracted to madness. There are new, powerful items that can be built from the [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") that they leave behind when killed.

**Save Slots** - You can have up to four save games at once now. Your existing save will be imported into the first slot when you start the game for the first time.

**[Sandbox Mode](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode")** - This is the game as you all know it. There will eventually be a customization screen before you start a level, but you just get the default generation for now.

**Experimental [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode")** - When you start a new game, you can choose to play in adventure (i.e. story) mode. Currently, there are five levels of difficulty as you progress through the levels. This is an early test, so we have a lot of work to do to make these levels meaningful and fun. We also need to add the story’s ending. This is for experienced DS players who want a taste of the future.

**Pathfinding** - Monsters and followers can navigate around corners and walls.

**Mod Support (steam only)**- Modding is now allowed! We’re distributing the source scripts with the game, so have a look in data/scripts, and see what you can do. There is an example (machine-translated) French language pack included with the game to get you started. [See the modding forum](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/forumdisplay.php?54-Don-t-Starve-Beta-Mods-amp-Tools) for more details.

**New Craftables:**

* [Bush Hat](/wiki/Bush_Hat "Bush Hat") - Hide from your enemies in plain sight.
* [Night Light](/wiki/Night_Light "Night Light") - Light your nights with nightmare fuel.
* [Night Armour](/wiki/Night_Armour "Night Armour") - Protects the flesh, but sacrifices the mind.
* [Night Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword") - Live by the sword, go crazy by the sword.
* [Cobbles](/wiki/Cobblestones "Cobblestones") - Build your own roads.
* [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy") + [Pumpkin Cookies](/wiki/Pumpkin_Cookie "Pumpkin Cookie") - New recipes! Mmmmmmm!

**Tuning:**

* The tent is cheaper to make, and doesn’t restore health any more.
* Natural roads are curvy and look better.
* There is a way for non-Wilson characters to find beard hairs in the wild.
* Sometimes, when you find pig villages, they will have carrot and flower farms.
* Lots of small, under-the-hood changes to the world gen.
* Seeds provide less hunger.
* Birds drop a feather -or- a morsel, never both.
* Rabbits take longer to respawn.
* Hounds drop teeth less often.
* Traps and Toothtraps have slightly fewer uses.
* Farms take a bit longer to grow.
* Birds won’t land on seeds if you are standing too close to them.
* Spider dens spit out less creep.
* Creep without a spider den disappears. (As a side-effect, creep can no longer be picked up and placed.)
* Walls have more health.
* Torches cost more to build, but last longer.
* Corpses are back!

**Bug Fixes:**

* There is much less mist in the graveyards, since it was causing performance and visibility problems.
* Stuff that falls near the ocean shouldn’t disappear.
* Stone walls don’t take fire damage.
* Hounds don’t follow you through the teleportato.
* You can’t be killed while you are using the teleportato.
* Stumps no longer rain from the sky on loading some games.
* Rabbits no longer phase through obstacles.
* Placers for campfires won’t disappear into the night when trying to build them.
* Heated beefalo won’t go out of their way to aggro walls.
* Spider queens no longer give birth to unlimited spiders when they have a combat target.

**Deprecations:**
The old world gen and the old research system have been removed. If you have an existing save game that was using the old research system, you will have to build some science machines to unlock your recipes.

## January 29, 2013 – Progress![]

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/14/Progress%21.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130501214017

You can escape the world by finding [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing") and activating it. You get to keep your inventory, and you cash-out any XP that you have and unlock characters without dying. This is the first step towards story mode. The world that you escape to is no harder than the first, but this will change soon!

**New [Research](/wiki/Research "Research") Method:** Under the new research method, you unlock access to tiers of recipes by building research machines. You can unlock a specific recipe by building it near an active machine, after which point you can build it anywhere. Your known recipes last as long as you do - they will travel with you to new worlds if you escape, but you will lose them if you die. There are no more research points or grinding. The science machine is now a bit cheaper to make, and the alchemy engine is a bit more expensive.
This is a big change, so we've made it optional for the time being. When you start a new world, you will get to choose between the new research method or the old one. Your progress in the old method is not available in the new method, but will be there if you switch back. We will be phasing out the old method soon, but wanted to introduce the new one carefully.

**New Character: [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom")** The Librarian can be unlocked with XP. She gets a bonus research tier, because she is so smart.

**New Creatures:**

* There are [Baby Beefalo](/wiki/Baby_Beefalo "Baby Beefalo"). You can eat them, if you are a terrible person.
* [Worm Holes](/wiki/Worm_Hole "Worm Hole") are sprinkled throughout new worlds. I dare you to click on one!
* [Koalefant](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant"), an elusive herbivore that you can hunt. He is hard to find, and harder to catch. He drops [Koalefant Trunk](/wiki/Koalefant_Trunk "Koalefant Trunk") and lots of meat.

**New Craftables:**

* You can build three types of defensive [Walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls") ([Hay Walls](/wiki/Hay_Wall "Hay Wall"), [Wood Walls](/wiki/Wood_Wall "Wood Wall"), and [Stone Walls](/wiki/Stone_Wall "Stone Wall")). These can be destroyed by monsters, and repaired by you. The AI pathfinding is not done yet but will probably go in the next update, so enjoy confusing the heck out of pigmen while you can.
* You can make wooden floor tiles and place them like turf.
* You can make a [Boomerang](/wiki/Boomerang "Boomerang") and throw it at other creatures. Just be careful when it flies back at you!
* You can build a [Pitchfork](/wiki/Pitchfork "Pitchfork"), which takes over turfing duties from the shovel.
* You can craft a nice, comfy [Breezy Vest](/wiki/Breezy_Vest "Breezy Vest").

**New Other Stuff:**

* Spider dens produce creep tiles [Sticky Webbing](/wiki/Spider_Den#Sticky_Webbing "Spider Den") that slow down movement. You can dig them up and place them if you like.
* Added a better death effect for creatures.
* Spline-based [Roads](/wiki/Roads "Roads") look better, and make you walk faster.

**Balance Changes:**

* Every new [Meat Effigy](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy") that you create takes a chunk of your max health. It gets returned when you die, or when you destroy the effigy.
* Made [Monster Lasagna](/wiki/Monster_Lasagna "Monster Lasagna") recipe that shows up when you use too much monster meat in the crock pot.
* Cooked / crocked foods inherit spoiledness from their ingredients (with a small bonus).
* The "new world gen" is now the default. The old method will soon be deprecated.
* Added a character quip when [Hounds](/wiki/Hound "Hound") are approaching.
* The [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent") no longer swaps characters - it is now acts as a super-powerful bedroll that restores all health and hunger.
* [Honey Nuggets](/wiki/Honey_Nuggets "Honey Nuggets") and [Honey Ham](/wiki/Honey_Ham "Honey Ham") spoil a bit faster.

**Misc Bug fixes:**

* Birds don't spawn seeds when flying away if there's already seeds nearby.
* [Tooth Trap](/wiki/Tooth_Trap "Tooth Trap") can be reset with Right-click.
* Beard fountain doesn't... fountain.
* Teenbird and [Tallbird](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird") aggression fixes.
* If you die with something in your hand it will drop on the ground instead of disappearing.
* Fix for missing [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King") in new world generation.
* Fix for hangs in new world generation.
* Massive speed up for new world generation.
* Fixed bird/wilson animation freak-outs on slower machines.
* Darts and poop won't magically accumulate at the world origin.
* Berries won't show up in farm plots.

## January 15, 2013 – Spoiled Rotten[]

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/1b/Spoiled Rotten.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130501214052

* [Food](/wiki/Food "Food") spoils over long periods of time. Stale and Spoiled foods are less beneficial. Rotten food is practically inedible, but can be used as fuel or fertilizer.
* [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") and [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") values have been re-tuned across the board. Characters have a larger hunger buffer now.
* [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") foods are stackable up to 40.
* You can build an [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box") to mitigate spoilage.
* New unlockable character: [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78"), a robot who can eat spoiled food with no penalties, and who hates all living things.
* Smallbirds grow up to become angsty Teenbirds ([Smallish Tallbirds](/wiki/Smallish_Tallbird "Smallish Tallbird") in-game). Teenbirds grow up to be [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird") and leave the player.
* The mysterious Otto Von Chesterfield (an [Eye Bone](/wiki/Eye_Bone "Eye Bone") item that spawn a [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester")) can be found in some [Marshes](/wiki/Marsh "Marsh"), and can be befriended (a new world is needed to find the Eye Bone).
* [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") travel in proper herds now. Herds regenerate off-screen (currently with adults)
* Beefalo herds become agitated when they go into heat, and will chase away the player if they are not wearing a [Beefalo Hat](/wiki/Beefalo_Hat "Beefalo Hat").
* Beefalo sometimes drop a [Beefalo Horn](/wiki/Beefalo_Horn "Beefalo Horn"), which can be used to move beefalos around.
* The [Spiderhat](/wiki/Spiderhat "Spiderhat") is no longer craftable - the player will just wear the [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen")'s head directly. It also can't be used to steal [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders") from an existing Queen.
* Steam cloud can be disabled (details below)
* Camera controls: CTRL+P will freeze the camera in place; CTRL+H will hide the HUD.
* Minor tweaks and fixes
* Fixed various save/load issues

### January 16, 2013 - Hotfix[]

* Cooked mandrake doesn't crash when you eat it

## January 8, 2013 - Turf![]

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/fd/Turf%21.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130501214104

## December 19, 2012 – Long Live the Queen![]

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/4e/Long Live the Queen.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130501214035

**New features**

* [Spider dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") have a full life cycle. Tiers are more meaningful, and higher tiered dens will require strategy to overcome.
* [Spider queens](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen") come out of the highest-tier nests to wreak havoc and spread spideryness.
* A new type of [warrior spider](/wiki/Spider#Spider_Warrior "Spider") protects high-level dens and the queen. They are resistant to kiting, so a frontal assault is not recommended.
* Wilson can build [fire darts](/wiki/Blow_Dart#Fire_Dart "Blow Dart"), and light pretty much every creature on [fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire").
* Wilson can build a [spider hat](/wiki/Spiderhat "Spiderhat") from [egg sacks](/wiki/Spider_Eggs "Spider Eggs") that lets him control spiders. Just be careful when you take it off!
* Wilson can build [tooth traps](/wiki/Tooth_Traps "Tooth Traps") and use them for defense or for guilt-free [rabbit](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit") hunting.
* There is a new, experimental [map](/wiki/Map "Map") gen algorithm that you can use. It is a work in progress and is largely untested and unbalanced, so you may not live for very long! (Don’t worry, though - the old map gen is still the default!)
* Pet [Smallbirds](/wiki/Smallbird "Smallbird") will demand food when hungry, and can starve to death.
* Wilson can build a [warm hat](/wiki/Winter_Hat "Winter Hat"). It... makes something happen.
* New "epic fight" and "dawn" [music](/wiki/Soundtrack "Soundtrack").

**Tuning**

* High-level [hound](/wiki/Hound "Hound") attacks are more intense.
* [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") is silent until you reach a certain threshold of naughtiness.
* [Farming](/wiki/Farming "Farming") takes longer.
* Some [fruits](/wiki/Fruit "Fruit") and [cooked](/wiki/Cooking "Cooking") foods are a bit less potent.
* [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") drop less frequently.
* The [birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage") seed sorter is less reliable.
* [Pig houses](/wiki/Pig_House "Pig House") wear out after a certain number of its [pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") are killed.
* [Werepig](/wiki/Pig#Werepig "Pig") [monster meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") threshold increased to 4, werepigs drop normal [meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat").

**Fixes**

* Stuff that falls out of bounds will disappear after a bit.
* Most monsters will ignore things that are out of bounds.
* [Gobblers](/wiki/Gobbler "Gobbler") and Krampus try to avoid getting caught against the edge of the world.
* [Fireflies](/wiki/Fireflies "Fireflies") drop individually.
* Mobs shouldn’t get stuck in sliding animations.

### December 20, 2012 - Hotfix[]

* Blank out attacks on spiders just after den spawn
* Disable pighouse exhaustion (for now)
* Warrior spider have somewhat random attack periods (so that they don't pounce you at the same time)
* Fewer spiders are released when hitting a nest, and fewer of them are warriors
* Warrior spider attacks less frequently, and does less damage
* Seeds grow time and drop rates are a bit less nerfed
* Fix [gold](/wiki/Gold_Nugget "Gold Nugget") getting stuck on pig king's head
* Fix exploding [beemine](/wiki/Bee_Mine "Bee Mine")-in-[backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack")
* [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard") shouldn't spawn invisibly any more

**GENERAL FIXES:**

* Tallbird eggs are no longer stackable.

**FARMS**

* Farm plots are fully fertilized when they are built
* Farm plots have much higher [fertilizer](/wiki/Fertilizer "Fertilizer") capacity (used to be 6, now is 10,20,30)
* Manure fertilizes farms more efficiently and speeds crop growth more efficiently

**DEPLOYING / BUILDING**

* an unsuccessful deploy will not consume the deployable
* chests can be placed closer together
* non-colliding deployables can be placed closer together
* twigs and grass do not become exhaustible until you transplant them (in existing saves, everything counts as not-yet-transplanted, because I wasn’t tracking this before)
* transplanted grass is good for 20 cycles per poop

**USING GRASS**

* fillers (other than twigs and petals) can no longer be used in the crock pot
* traps can be used 10 times instead of 5

* Minerhat lasts twice as long
* Fire fueling values have been updated

### December 12, 2012 - Hotfix[]

**Bug fixes**

* Profile saving should work again on Chrome. Unfortunately, there's no way to get back any data that was lost to the bug while it was live.

* There is a workaround available for those having trouble starting up with low-memory video cards (see below)

**Tuning**

* Krampus comes a little less frequently, and in smaller numbers.
* Krampus will start to forgive naughtiness if you aren't naughty for a while. So you can still kill lots of bunnies with impunity if you pace yourself and diversify your food sources.
* Krampus will target loose items on the ground before going after chests.
* Krampus runs a little slower.
