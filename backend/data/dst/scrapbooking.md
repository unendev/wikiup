*Exclusive to:* Don't Starve Together

The **Scrapbook** is a feature added to [Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together") in the [Terrors Below](/wiki/From_Beyond "From Beyond") update. It is a collection of Items and Creatures that have previously been discovered by the Player, containing details such as creature Health and Attack damage, Items, Food (while [Crock Pot dishes](/wiki/Guides/Crock_Pot_Dishes "Guides/Crock Pot Dishes") are listed, their recipes are listed separately in the [Cookbook](/wiki/Cookbook "Cookbook")) and the stats they give, and examination quotes from each of the playable characters. You can use [Scrapbook Pages](/wiki/Scrapbook_Page "Scrapbook Page") to discover things you don't know. In this case, the object will be displayed in black and white, and its characteristics will not be displayed until you examine the object directly.

The scrapbook can be fully unlocked with this command;

```
TheScrapbookPartitions:DebugUnlockEverything()

```

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The Scrapbooking was introduced in the *[Terrors Below](/wiki/From_Beyond#Terrors_Below "From Beyond")* update.
* The game file shows that Scrapbook also has an unused "[Biomes](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes")", "[Seasons](/wiki/Season "Season")", "Things" and "POI" (Point of interest) categories, which may be something that will be added in the future.
  + "Things" and "POI" categories were then later added to the Scrapbook in the *[Host of Horrors](/wiki/From_Beyond#Host_of_Horrors "From Beyond")* update.
* The game file shows that Scrapbook also has an unused sorting dividing food into "GENERIC", "INSECT", "BERRY", "RAW", "BURNT", "WOOD", "MONSTER".
* The game file shows that Scrapbook also has an unused sorting dividing sanity auras into "A LITTLE SCARY", "A LITTLE CALMING", "QUITE CALMING", "VERY CALMING".
