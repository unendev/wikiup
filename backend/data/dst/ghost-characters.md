**“**Oooh oOooh. OoOOh?**”**

–Ghost Player

**Ghost Players** or **Ghost Characters** appear whenever a player dies in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. They can fly around and haunt objects. Ghost Players may resurrect themselves via [Touch Stones](/wiki/Touch_Stone "Touch Stone"), [Meat Effigies](/wiki/Meat_Effigies "Meat Effigies"), or [Life Giving Amulets](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet"). Other players are able to resurrect them using a [telltale heart](/wiki/Telltale_Heart "Telltale Heart"). [Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda") can also use [Second Chance Watch](/wiki/Second_Chance_Watch "Second Chance Watch") to revive herself and other characters. They also emit just enough light to ward off [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie").

In Survival Mode, if any players have died and become ghosts, a ghost icon will appear by all other players' [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") meter and their Sanity will decrease by 3.3/min (0.055/sec) for every ghost. This penalty encourages the resurrection of fallen players. When all players have died and become ghosts, a 120 second timer will begin that will end the game and generate a new world (the timer will be reset back to 120 seconds if the server is shut down and then reconnected). If a Ghost Player revives (via Touch Stone for example) before the countdown ends, the world will continue.

In Wilderness Mode, the player respawns at a random location on the map after being killed, so ghosts do not appear in this mode.

In Endless Mode, the game will go on even when every player has become a ghost. Ghost Players will be able to revive at the [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern") for a maximum Health penalty. In addition, Ghost Players will not drain Sanity in this mode, unlike Survival mode.

## Haunting[]

Haunting is an action that can only be performed by Ghost Players. It has a variety of different effects, depending on the entity that is being haunted. Examples of haunting objects are moving [items](/wiki/Items "Items") around, turning [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree") into [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard"), and turning [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") into [Evil Flowers](/wiki/Evil_Flower "Evil Flower"). After being haunted, an entity cannot be haunted again for a few more seconds. Evil flowers can also be used to create [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel").

Most objects fall into a few categories of haunting effects, most of which are not particularly useful. A few entities have unusual haunt effects, which are often quite useful. Below are lists of known objects that can be haunted.

Inventory items that are not listed only have a chance to be launched a short distance away.

### Beneficial Effects[]

* [Suspicious tracks](/wiki/Suspicious_Dirt_Pile "Suspicious Dirt Pile") will be investigated.

### Neutral Effects[]

* [Abigail](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail") will be angered briefly.
* [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") will attempt to spawn a baby after they are done panicking. However, this will most likely fail because Baby Beefalo can only spawn offscreen, and the player ghost is present.
* Splumonkeys will also attempt to spawn a new Splumonkey. This will also fail for the same reason.
* [Ewecus](/wiki/Ewecus "Ewecus") will also attempt to spawn another Ewecus. This may be leftover from copying the Beefalo prefab.
* [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush") will get rustled (this does not produce [Gobblers](/wiki/Gobbler "Gobbler")).
* [Pig Heads](/wiki/Pig_Head "Pig Head") and [Merm Heads](/wiki/Merm_Head "Merm Head") will open their eyes like on a [full moon](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle").
* The [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King") will reject player advances.
* A [grave](/wiki/Grave "Grave") spawns a ghost as a follower.
* Vigor Mortis boosts Ghost Character's speed for 2 sec

### Panic[]

These creatures will panic for a few seconds after being haunted. Panicking involves running around, pausing previous aggro. Some of the following mobs will run away from player ghosts, making them practically impossible to haunt.

* Beefalo (including babies)
* [Batilisk](/wiki/Batilisk "Batilisk")
* [Butterfly](/wiki/Butterfly "Butterfly")
* [Killer Bee](/wiki/Killer_Bee "Killer Bee")
* [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester")
* [Clockwork Rook](/wiki/Clockwork_Rook "Clockwork Rook"), [Clockwork Knight](/wiki/Clockwork_Knight "Clockwork Knight"), [Clockwork Bishop](/wiki/Clockwork_Bishop "Clockwork Bishop")
* [Bunnyman](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman")
* [Frog](/wiki/Frog "Frog")
* Hounds
* [Koalefants](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant")
* [Merm](/wiki/Merm "Merm")
* [Splumonkey](/wiki/Splumonkey "Splumonkey")
* [Mosquito](/wiki/Mosquito "Mosquito")
* [Pengull](/wiki/Pengull "Pengull")
* [Gobbler](/wiki/Gobbler "Gobbler")
* [Pig](/wiki/Pig "Pig")
* [Rabbit](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit")
* [Rock Lobster](/wiki/Rock_Lobster "Rock Lobster")
* [Ewecus](/wiki/Ewecus "Ewecus")

* [Tallbird](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird") (including younger forms)
* [MacTusk](/wiki/MacTusk "MacTusk") and [Wee MacTusk](/wiki/Wee_MacTusk "Wee MacTusk")

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") and [Woodie's](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie") ghosts were made to resemble [R2-D2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2 "wikipedia:R2-D2") and [Chewbacca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewbacca "wikipedia:Chewbacca"), respectively, from the *[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars "wikipedia:Star Wars")* films.
* [Wendy](/wiki/Wendy "Wendy")'s ghost is an almost exact, horizontally flipped copy of [Abigail](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail"). The only difference is the color of her flower, which is yellow.
* Ghost Characters are slowed down by [Sticky Webbing](/wiki/Spider_Den#Sticky_Webbing "Spider Den"), despite their presumably ethereal forms.
* As a Ghost, the player does not update the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") while exploring unknown areas.
* Ghost Characters' quotes appear to be similar to [Wilbur](/wiki/Wilbur "Wilbur")'s, except with "o" and "h" as the only letters used.
* Pigs will still tell ghost characters to "Back off" if they get too close.
* Each character has a unique ghost transformation.
* Unlike other characters, [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie"), [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox"), [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood"), and [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt") have more than one ghost form.
* The [Werebeaver](/wiki/Cursed_Woodie "Cursed Woodie")'s and the Weregoose's ghosts are the only two to possess a mouth.
