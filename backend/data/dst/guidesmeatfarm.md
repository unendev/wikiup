### Meat Farm Guide[]

Want a steady fount of [food](/wiki/Food "Food")? Well, this is the guide for you.

## You Will Need[]

* [Bunny Puff](/wiki/Bunny_Puff "Bunny Puff") x4
* [Carrot](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot") x10
* [Boards](/wiki/Boards "Boards") x4
* [Hound's Tooth](/wiki/Hound%27s_Tooth "Hound's Tooth") x 10
* [Cut Grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass") x30
* [Log](/wiki/Log "Log") x10
* [Alchemy Engine](/wiki/Alchemy_Engine "Alchemy Engine")

## Making It[]

Use the [Bunny Puffs](/wiki/Bunny_Puff "Bunny Puff"), [Carrots](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot"), and [Boards](/wiki/Boards "Boards") to make a [Rabbit Hutch](/wiki/Rabbit_Hutch "Rabbit Hutch"). Place it somewhere with some space around it.

Rabbit Hutch

 

Make [Ropes](/wiki/Rope "Rope") with the grass, the player should get 10 rope.

Use the [Hound's Tooths](/wiki/Hound%27s_Tooth "Hound's Tooth"), [Ropes](/wiki/Rope "Rope"), and [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log") to make [Tooth Traps](/wiki/Tooth_Traps "Tooth Traps").

Place the tooth traps around the exit of the rabbit hutch, In a half circle shape. Have more on the front of the hutch and less on the sides.

## The Result[]

The result should look something like the picture below to the right. Note that in the picture a lot more than 10 traps were used, however 10 is enough. Also there is a second farm only started (to the left).

"Meat Farm"

 

When the "farm" is finished it should produce 2 carrots, 1 [meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") (75%) and 1 bunny puff (25%) every day. Check the trap for drops and reset tooth traps every morning. There should be drops every morning, but there is a slight chance that the [bunnyman](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") spawns on the wrong side of the hutch and therefor doesn't get killed. To avoid this more tooth traps can be placed around the hutch. Also, even though he survives the first time, he should die the next night when he tries to get out.

The farm allows the player to get fresh carrots in the middle of the winter.

Check the [Bunnyman](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") page for more info.
