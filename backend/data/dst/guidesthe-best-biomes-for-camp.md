## Savanna[]

The [savanna](/wiki/Savanna "Savanna") biome can be identified by it's yellow [turf](/wiki/Turf "Turf"). Savanna biomes are commonly large, though can also be quite small. There are a range of pros and cons in the savanna biome. It is always a good idea to at least settle near a savanna biome, if possible, as they can be used for a range of materials, as well as protection again [hounds](/wiki/Hound "Hound") and [bosses](/wiki/Boss_Monsters "Boss Monsters").

### Overview[]

There is a quite a lot of [grass throughout](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass") the savanna biome. Enough so that the player will almost always have a supply on hand, even if they just set up nearby a savanna, especially if the savanna is larger. Grass can be used for [rope](/wiki/Rope "Rope"), [traps](/wiki/Trap "Trap"), [fires](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire"), [torches](/wiki/Torch "Torch"), and [backpacks](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack"), among many other things.

[Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") also spawn in savannas, with a more frequent chance to spawn in the larger savannas . They come in herds of various sizes. They can be used as protection against hounds, as well as various [bosses](/wiki/Boss_Monsters "Boss Monsters"). As hounds will eventually lose interest in the player and attack other mobs, and all beefalo in the area will attack a monster that attacks one of them, it is easy to use them against [Hounds](/wiki/Hounds "Hounds"). This is also true for any monster with an area of effect attack, such as the [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops"). However, beware that tougher monsters with this AoE attack may be able to overpower and kill beefalo. Beefalo also occasionally drop [manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure"), which can be used to make and fertilize [farms](/wiki/Farms "Farms"), as well as fertilize certain [plants](/wiki/Plants "Plants"). Beefalo can also be shaved, using a [razor](/wiki/Razor "Razor"), for [beefalo wool](/wiki/Beefalo_Wool "Beefalo Wool"), which can be used to make [winter hats](/wiki/Winter_Hat "Winter Hat"), along with some other things. Beefalo will also go into mating season during [spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring") (Or randomly, if [Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants") is not installed.) When in mating season, they will attack anything and everything, including the player. However, if the player is wearing a [beefalo hat,](/wiki/Beefalo_Hat "Beefalo Hat") they will not get attacked.

[Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbits "Rabbits") are very frequent. They can be captured with [traps](/wiki/Trap "Trap"), and killed for [morsels](/wiki/Morsel "Morsel"). The live ones can also be used to make a [prestihatitator](/wiki/Prestihatitator "Prestihatitator") and [earmuffs](/wiki/Rabbit_Earmuffs "Rabbit Earmuffs").If the player is insane then they turn into [beardlings](/wiki/Beardlings "Beardlings"), which can be killed for [beard hair](/wiki/Beard_Hair "Beard Hair"), [monster meat](/wiki/Monster_meat "Monster meat") or [nightmare fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel"). During [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn"), [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer"), and [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), they can be used as a great food source. In [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"), however, their holes are closed up and they will not come out unless their hole is dug up, which will permanently get rid of the hole.

[Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider") will rarely spawn in savannas, but on the occasion that they do spawn, they can be used to obtain [spider glands](/wiki/Spider_Gland "Spider Gland"), which are a healing item, [monster meat](/wiki/Monster_meat "Monster meat"), which can be used as a crockpot filler or be eaten at a cost to the player, and [silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk"), which can be used for [sewing kits](/wiki/Sewing_Kit "Sewing Kit"), [tents](/wiki/Tent "Tent"), [top hats](/wiki/Top_Hat "Top Hat"), and many other things. Spiders are easily killed and many even spawn a [spider queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen") which can be killed to the player's benefit.

[Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree") and [saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") do not spawn in savanna biomes, posing a disadvantage to the player as they are both extremely important to survival. However, the player can dig up saplings and plant them in the savanna. Unlike many plants, they do not require [fertilizer](/wiki/Fertilizers "Fertilizers"). Trees can be planted using [pinecones](/wiki/Pine_Cone "Pine Cone") or [birchnuts](/wiki/Birchnut "Birchnut"). They do also not require fertilizer, so it is at little cost to the player.

Food sources like [berry bushes](/wiki/Berry_bush "Berry bush") also do not spawn in the savanna. This is yet another disadvantage, as berry bushes, [carrots](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot"), and other food sources can be eaten or used in the [crock pot](/wiki/Crock_pot "Crock pot") to further their benefits. However, berry bushes can be planted in the savanna and the manure found in the savanna from the beefalo can be used to fertilize them. Also, any excess berries that [rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot") can be used to fertilize them if and when they need fertilizing again.

### Strategies[]

It's easy to keep up on food sources because of the frequent [rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit"), except in spring when the rabbit holes close up. It is not recommended to dig them up as that permanently gets rid of the rabbits that will spawn there.

In https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f8/Reign of Giants icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20140408110712[Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"), there's an occasional [Frog Rain](/wiki/Frog_Rain "Frog Rain"). Since [beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") go into heat during the spring and will attack everything, they will attack the [frogs](/wiki/Frog "Frog"). This sparks a huge war against the beefalo and the frogs, where the beefalo typically come out on top. However, a few beefalo may be killed, resulting in [meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat"), [wool and](/wiki/Beefalo_Wool "Beefalo Wool") possible [beefalo horns.](/wiki/Beefalo_Horn "Beefalo Horn") And because so many frogs die, there will be many [frog legs](/wiki/Frog_Legs "Frog Legs") which are used as a food source.

Another advantage during Spring is that, when the [moose/goose](/wiki/Moose/Goose "Moose/Goose") spawns, the beefalo will still be in heat. Since the moose/goose can only attack one creature at a time with no area of effect attack, the beefalo will easily overtake and kill her, resulting in meat, [down feathers](/wiki/Down_Feather "Down Feather") and drum sticks, and an easy boss kill. It is also possible to wait to lure her to the beefalo until she lays her [egg](/wiki/Moose/Goose_Egg "Moose/Goose Egg"), and then lead both her and the resulting moslings to the beefalo, resulting in even more food and feathers.

Overall, savannas are a pretty good place to set up camp if the player is prepared to move [saplings](/wiki/Saplings "Saplings") and [trees](/wiki/Trees "Trees") there, or take frequent outings to other biomes to collect these resources. There are few dangers, and the ones that are present can be easily managed. ([Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders") and [beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") in heat are the two dangers in savannas.)

### Everything that spawns[]

Here's a quick and easy list of what spawn commonly, infrequently or occasionally in savanna biomes.

Abundant:

* [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass")
* [Rabbit Holes](/wiki/Rabbit_Hole "Rabbit Hole")
* [Redbirds](/wiki/Redbirds "Redbirds")
* [Crows](/wiki/Crows "Crows")

Occasional:

* [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo")
* [Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder")

Rare:

* [Flowers](/wiki/Flowers "Flowers")
* [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den")
* [Crank Thing](/wiki/Crank_Thing "Crank Thing") (Singleplayer)

## Rockyland[]

The [Rockyland](/wiki/Rockyland "Rockyland") biome is filled to the brim with [boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder") and other materials. There are few threats, and multiple benefits to living in the rockyland. They are important to survival due to their abundance of certain materials.It can be recognized by the grey, stoney turf.

[Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder") spawn abundantly in this biome. This is important to obtain [rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks"), which can be used for [cut stone](/wiki/Cut_Stone "Cut Stone"), [fire pits](/wiki/Fire_pit "Fire pit"), [science machines](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine"), and more. They also drop [nitre](/wiki/Nitre "Nitre"), which is used for [endothermic fires](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire "Endothermic Fire") in [Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants"). [Gold Veins](/wiki/Gold_Vein "Gold Vein") also spawn frequently, which drop both rocks and [gold](/wiki/Gold "Gold") when mined, which is used for science machines, [electric doodads](/wiki/Electrical_Doodad "Electrical Doodad"), [lightning rods](/wiki/Lightning_rod "Lightning rod") and many more things. Gold is also extremely important to gameplay.

[Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") will also occasionally spawn, which can be used for [silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk"), [spider glands](/wiki/Spider_Gland "Spider Gland"), and [monster meat.](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") They can also be used as a distraction to [hounds](/wiki/Hound "Hound") and bosses like the [deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops"). When one spider den spawns in the rockyland, often there are many spider dens grouped together.

[Tallbird nests](/wiki/Tallbird_Nest "Tallbird Nest") will rarely spawn. [Tallbirds](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird") can be farmed for [meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat"), dropping two each. [Tallbird's eggs](/wiki/Tallbird_Egg "Tallbird Egg") that they lay can also be eaten for some [hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"). They don't spoil and can therefore be used as an emergency food source. They can also be used to make [bacon and eggs](/wiki/Bacon_and_Eggs "Bacon and Eggs").

In the [Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants") DLC, [mini glaciers](/wiki/Mini_Glacier "Mini Glacier") spawn as well. These can be mined for [ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice"), which can be eaten to cool down the player in [summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer"), and make [ice flingomatics](/wiki/Ice_Flingomatic "Ice Flingomatic") to prevent [fires](/wiki/Fire "Fire"). It also makes good [crock pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") filler.

In [Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together"), [Grass Gekkos](/wiki/Grass_Gekko "Grass Gekko") spawn. They run away from the player when approached but will drop [grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass") when doing so. This can be used as a good way to obtain grass which is extremely important to gameplay. They can also be killed for some grass and [leafy meat](/wiki/Leafy_Meat "Leafy Meat").

Unfortunately, [trees](/wiki/Trees "Trees"), [saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") and [grass](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft") do not spawn in rockyland, nor do [berry bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush"). Nothing can be transported to the rocky land, however, the player can use a [pitchfork](/wiki/Pitchfork "Pitchfork") to pull out the rocky floor and plant the bushes, seedlings and grass onto the empty floor.

### Strategies[]

Living in the rockyland is pretty straight forward. However, there are a few tips and tricks to surviving in it.

For example, tallbirds and spiders that are in the same biome and near each other can be led to fight. This especially works if Webber is the one being played, as he can befriend spiders and have them attack tallbirds. However, tallbirds and spiders can fight even without one being befriended. The tallbirds and spiders will both have deaths on their side, which can result in meat, monster meat, silk and spider glands. Tallbird eggs can also be pulled from the empty tallbird nests. However, spiders will eat meat and monster meat off the ground, so make sure to pick it up quickly.

### Everything that spawns[]

Abundant:

* [Flint](/wiki/Flint "Flint")
* [Rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks")
* [Crows](/wiki/Crows "Crows")
* [Gold Veins](/wiki/Gold_Vein "Gold Vein")
* [Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder")

Occasional:

* [Gold](/wiki/Gold "Gold")
* [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den")
* [Mini Glaciers](/wiki/Mini_Glacier "Mini Glacier") (Reign of Giants)
* [Grass Gekkos](/wiki/Grass_Gekko "Grass Gekko") (Don't Starve Together)

Rare

* [Tallbird Nests](/wiki/Tallbird_Nest "Tallbird Nest")

## Swamp[]

The swamp is the most dangerous place to set up camp, but arguably the most rewarding. It is abundant with certain materials should the player try to access them, and, if done right, can be one of the best places for a long-term base(See [Guide:Marsh Camp](/wiki/Guides/Marsh_Camp_Guide "Guides/Marsh Camp Guide") for more information)

The most dangerous thing in the swamp are probably tentacles. They hide in the ground and then strike when a mob or player goes near them. They're unable to be seen when they're in the ground, the only sign that they're there being some movement in the ground. If something stays too close to them for too long, they come up from the ground and strike everything around them. Nearly everything triggers them. However, they drop tentacle spikes, which are weapons better then spears, when killed. They also drop monster meat and tentacle spots.

Spiders spawn frequently in swamps.
