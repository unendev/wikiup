Large Casserole Dish - An improved version of the regular brazier. Holds 4 ingredients, allowing you to cook more complex dishes than a small casserole dish. You can also put only 3 ingredients inside to cook on a small brazier. A Large Brazier can be purchased from Pipton or obtained from one of the locked safes.

The rest of the characteristics of a large casserole dish are similar to a [small](/wiki/Small_Casserole_Dish "Small Casserole Dish") one.
