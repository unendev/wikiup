Oah!

 

This page explains [quotes](/wiki/Character_quotes "Character quotes") "said" by [Wilbur](/wiki/Wilbur "Wilbur"). Wilbur cannot speak in a meaningful language, instead he makes random monkey-like noises (expressed as words on the screen as opposed to sound) when he announces or inspects something. These quotes give no useful information. They are also completely random, the quote will change even when examining the same object.

The quotes are generated with 1 to 6 "words", each of which contain 2 to 5 characters.

* The first character in each word is always an "O".
* The next 1 to 3 characters consist of an "o" (70% chance) or an "a".
* There is a 1/3 chance the word ends there, if not the last character will be either an "e" or an "h" with equal chance.

Between each word, there is a 60% chance that there will only be a space. Otherwise, with equal likelihood, a comma, a period, a question mark or an exclamation mark can be placed.

After all the words, the "sentence" will end with a period, a question mark or an exclamation mark with equal chance for each.

Wilbur can only speak two "real" words: When examining [(Cave) Bananas](/wiki/Cave_Banana "Cave Banana"), Cooked (Cave) Bananas, or [Cave Banana Trees](/wiki/Cave_Banana_Tree "Cave Banana Tree"), he will say *"'Nanas!"*. When examining a [Banana Pop](/wiki/Banana_Pop "Banana Pop"), or a burnt Cave Banana Tree, he will say *"'Nonos!"*.

Two more exceptions include when Wilbur, while trying to examine an object in the dark, will exclaim *"Eee! Eee! Eee!"*. Similarly, Wilbur will exclaim *"EEE! EEE!"* when activating the [Living Artifact](/wiki/Living_Artifact "Living Artifact").

Example Wilbur quotes:

* Ooo!
* Ooh? Ooae!
* Ooae Oooh Oaoa! Ooooe.
