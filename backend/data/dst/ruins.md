**“**A relic of an ancient civilization long dead from the ravages of time.**”**

A Ruins Sinkhole.

 

The **Ruins** are the last remnants of a forgotten subterranean civilization. The entrance to the Ruins are in the [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves"). The Ruins have their own theme, terrain, and biomes with unique creatures, statues, plants, and theme music. The Ruins have six different [Biomes](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes"): [Abyss](/wiki/Abyss "Abyss"), [Labyrinth](/wiki/Labyrinth "Labyrinth"), [Military](/wiki/Military "Military"), [Sacred](/wiki/Sacred "Sacred"), [Village](/wiki/Village "Village"), and [Wilds](/wiki/Wilds "Wilds") (Don't Starve Together also has a separate [Atrium](/wiki/Atrium "Atrium") area). [Earthquakes](/wiki/Earthquakes "Earthquakes") will occur in the Ruins, dropping the same [minerals](/wiki/Category:Minerals "Category:Minerals") as in the Caves. The ruins have no [Cave Lights](/wiki/Cave_Light "Cave Light") and no indication of a [Day-Night Cycle](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle").

In Don't Starve Each Cave connects to a different Ruins world. Each Ruins is generated as a new world upon entering it, just like Caves. The Ruins can only be entered through a plugged [Sinkhole](/wiki/Sinkhole "Sinkhole") found in the Caves. Ruins Sinkhole plugs are made of orange [Thulecite](/wiki/Thulecite "Thulecite"). Upon mining the [Thulecite](/wiki/Thulecite "Thulecite") plug, a rope will lead down to the Ruins through the Sinkhole, and [Batilisks](/wiki/Batilisks "Batilisks") will spawn from the hole into the Caves at night. The [Thulecite](/wiki/Thulecite "Thulecite") sinkhole is usually guarded by [Spilagmites](/wiki/Spilagmite "Spilagmite") and [Cave Spiders](/wiki/Cave_Spider "Cave Spider") or a [Rabbit Hutch](/wiki/Rabbit_Hutch "Rabbit Hutch") village and it can spawn at a random place at any biome most likely at [Stalagmite Terrain](/wiki/Stalagmite_Terrain "Stalagmite Terrain") biome or [sunken forest](/wiki/Sunken_Forest "Sunken Forest") biome. Mine-able resources in the ruins are never renewed.

In Don't Starve Together, the Ruins are located on the same level as the caves and connected to the [Mud Biome](/wiki/Mud_Biome "Mud Biome") by the [Lichen Meadow](/wiki/Lichen_Meadow "Lichen Meadow"), often approximately opposite the Blue [Mushtree Forest](/wiki/Mushtree_Forest "Mushtree Forest") and [Ancient Archive](/wiki/Ancient_Archive "Ancient Archive"). The ruins (only one) are generated with the rest of the Caves level. All the materials mined in the ruins can be "reset" or repopulated by killing the [Ancient Fuelweaver](/wiki/Reanimated_Skeleton#Ancient_Fuelweaver "Reanimated Skeleton") and waiting 4 minutes (see below).

## Exploration[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/8/84/Ruinsmap.png/revision/latest?cb=20131114152918 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/8/84/Ruinsmap.png/revision/latest?cb=20131114152918 

A fully explored Ruins map.

 

In Don't Starve, the starting area of the Ruins is surrounded by four massive [pillars](/wiki/Pillars "Pillars") and four [Broken Clockworks](/wiki/Broken_Clockworks "Broken Clockworks"), with a rope leading up to the Caves. The Ruins are completely [dark](/wiki/Night "Night"), causing a steady drain on [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"). Unlike the caves, the ruins are considered to be in a state of perpetual night, since creatures and plants will act accordingly. As the Ruins are explored, sections of the [map](/wiki/Map "Map") will show new icons and terrain specific to the Ruins.  The Ruins are also colder than the caves, especially if it is raining.

## Nightmare Cycle[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Nightmare Cycle](/wiki/Nightmare_Cycle "Nightmare Cycle")*

The Ruins exist in a state of flux called the Nightmare Cycle, which can be measured by the [Thulecite Medallion](/wiki/Thulecite_Medallion "Thulecite Medallion").  As the magical state becomes more intense, the likelihood of earthquakes increases. Its current state will affect the state of objects within it. [Nightmare Lights](/wiki/Nightmare_Light "Nightmare Light") will begin to open up, [Runic Turf](/wiki/Runic_Turf "Runic Turf") will glow red, and [Ancient Statues](/wiki/Ancient_Statue "Ancient Statue") will have a horrified look with [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") leaking from their mouths and eyes. [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") can attack the player regardless of their sanity level during the most intense stage. This is a great way to collect Nightmare Fuel, but is a bit overwhelming at an early stage in the game. The runes on the ground do not provide a light source despite glowing brightly.

## Creatures[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/e/ed/Slurper.png/revision/latest?cb=20231022232301 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/e/ed/Slurper.png/revision/latest?cb=20231022232301 

A [Slurper](/wiki/Slurper "Slurper").

 

The following creatures can be found in the Ruins:

* [Depths Worm](/wiki/Depths_Worm "Depths Worm")
* [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures")
* [Slurper](/wiki/Slurper "Slurper")
* [Splumonkey](/wiki/Splumonkey "Splumonkey")
* [Dangling Depth Dweller](/wiki/Dangling_Depth_Dweller "Dangling Depth Dweller")
* [Damaged Bishop](/wiki/Damaged_Bishop "Damaged Bishop")
* [Damaged Knight](/wiki/Damaged_Knight "Damaged Knight")
* [Damaged Rook](/wiki/Damaged_Rook "Damaged Rook")
* [Ancient Guardian](/wiki/Ancient_Guardian "Ancient Guardian")

Friendly damaged [Clockwork Monsters](/wiki/Category:Clockwork_Monsters "Category:Clockwork Monsters") can be made "Followers" by repairing Damaged Clockworks with [Gears](/wiki/Gears "Gears").

## Features[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/2e/Ruins pillar.png/revision/latest?cb=20200601191438 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/2e/Ruins pillar.png/revision/latest?cb=20200601191438 

A Ruins [pillar](/wiki/Pillars "Pillars")

 

Some of the ground and pillars in the Ruins are made out of a special material that starts to glow when light is shined upon it during the Nightmare Phase. The [Military](/wiki/Military "Military") and [Sacred](/wiki/Sacred "Sacred") biomes are mostly covered in this material. Also somewhere in the ruins there's a labyrinth, filled with Dangling Depth Dwellers, [Ornate Chests](/wiki/Ornate_Chests "Ornate Chests") and dead ends. At the center of this labyrinth resides the [Ancient Guardian](/wiki/Ancient_Guardian "Ancient Guardian"), who most players will challenge to get its rare [Horn](/wiki/Guardian%27s_Horn "Guardian's Horn").

Unlike Caves, surface plants like [Evergreens](/wiki/Evergreens "Evergreens"), [Saplings](/wiki/Saplings "Saplings"), [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush"), [Spiky Bushes](/wiki/Spiky_Bush "Spiky Bush"), and [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") are not found in the Ruins, although the player can still plant these items. Plants will regenerate after a few days of being harvested (except for trees). The only plants that can be found naturally in the ruins are [Light Flowers](/wiki/Light_Flower "Light Flower"), [Cave Banana Trees](/wiki/Cave_Banana_Tree "Cave Banana Tree"), and [Ferns](/wiki/Ferns "Ferns"). [Lichen](/wiki/Lichen "Lichen") is also exclusive to the ruins. Blue Mushrooms can be found here as well, usually in copious amounts.

An [Ancient Statue](/wiki/Ancient_Statue "Ancient Statue") during the [Nightmare Phase](/wiki/Nightmare_Cycle "Nightmare Cycle")

 

Objects found in the Ruins include [Relics](/wiki/Relics "Relics"), [Ancient Statues,](/wiki/Ancient_Statue "Ancient Statue") [Nightmare Lights](/wiki/Nightmare_Light "Nightmare Light") and the [Ancient Pseudoscience Station](/wiki/Ancient_Pseudoscience_Station "Ancient Pseudoscience Station"). Relics can be attacked and destroyed for various loot while Ancient Statues can be mined to yield Thulecite and various [Gems](/wiki/Gems "Gems"). Nightmare Lights can emit light and spawn Shadow Creatures depending on the Nightmare Cycle, while the Ancient Station will be used to craft some of the best items in the game, found in the [Ancient Tab](/wiki/Ancient_Tab "Ancient Tab"). Also in the wilds, there are [Splumonkey Pods](/wiki/Splumonkey_Pod "Splumonkey Pod") and special [Ponds](/wiki/Ponds "Ponds"). The ponds can be fished in to get [Eels](/wiki/Eel "Eel").

Within the entrance of the Ruins, corpses of the [Chess Monsters](/wiki/Chess_Monsters "Chess Monsters") can be found. When destroyed, they yield 1 [Frazzled Wires](/wiki/Frazzled_Wires "Frazzled Wires"), as well as potentially [Gears](/wiki/Gears "Gears") and other trinkets.

## Reign of Giants Reign of Giants[]

In *[Don't Starve: Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")*, the temperature of the Ruins depends on the temperature of the [overworld](/wiki/Surface_World "Surface World").

## Don't Starve Together Don't Starve Together[]

In *Don't Starve Together*, the Ruins were moved to the same level as the Caves. This was done to avoid the necessity of a third dedicated server to hold it on. The [Wilds](/wiki/Wilds "Wilds") biome can be found connecting to various cave biomes, as well as the ruins. An area full of [Cave Lichen](/wiki/Cave_Lichen "Cave Lichen") as well as [Slurpers](/wiki/Slurper "Slurper") serves as an indicator of being close to the ruins. There are also several new ways for entities to spawn.

In *[A New Reign](/wiki/A_New_Reign "A New Reign")*, the [Atrium](/wiki/Atrium "Atrium") Biome was introduced. The [Atrium](/wiki/Atrium "Atrium") Biome is completely separated from the main land and is only accessible by either killing a [Big Tentacle](/wiki/Tentacle#Big_Tentacle "Tentacle") found randomly within the caves, then jumping into its [Tentacle Pillar Hole](/wiki/Tentacle#Big_Tentacle "Tentacle") or by using a [Lazy Explorer](/wiki/Lazy_Explorer "Lazy Explorer"). Once the player makes it to the [Atrium](/wiki/Atrium "Atrium") Biome, they must pass the [Obelisks](/wiki/Obelisk "Obelisk") which will be in a closed state unless the player has less than 15% [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"). Players must be careful to never go above 15% [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"), otherwise they will be trapped on the island.

When the sanity is low, the [Resting Horror](/wiki/Resting_Horror "Resting Horror") can be found sitting on a [Relic Chair](/wiki/Relic_Chair "Relic Chair").

### Ancient Gateway Regeneration[]

If the [Ancient Fuelweaver](/wiki/Ancient_Fuelweaver "Ancient Fuelweaver") is killed, the [Ancient Gateway](/wiki/Ancient_Gateway "Ancient Gateway") will start to destabilize. After 4 minutes, the gate will respawn biome-specific resources (including [Damaged Clockworks](/wiki/Category:Clockwork_Monsters#Damaged_Knight "Category:Clockwork Monsters"), [Splumonkey Pods](/wiki/Splumonkey_Pod "Splumonkey Pod"), [Slurpers](/wiki/Slurper "Slurper"), [Depths Worms](/wiki/Depths_Worm "Depths Worm"), [Ancient Statues](/wiki/Ancient_Statue "Ancient Statue"), [Broken Clockworks](/wiki/Broken_Clockworks "Broken Clockworks"), and [Ancient Pseudoscience Stations](/wiki/Ancient_Pseudoscience_Station "Ancient Pseudoscience Station")) in their respective places of the Ruins, add new items to [Ornate Chests](/wiki/Ornate_Chest "Ornate Chest") or [Cave Holes](/wiki/Cave_Holes "Cave Holes"), and replace the Large Ornate Chest with an [Ancient Guardian](/wiki/Ancient_Guardian "Ancient Guardian").

| Objects regenerated by the Ancient Gateway explosion. |
| --- |
| Damaged Rook Damaged Knight Damaged Bishop Monkey Totem Slurper Depths Worm Ancient Ancient Face Broken clockworks Ancient Pseudoscience Station Ornate Chest Cave Hole Ancient Guardian |

Twenty days later, the Gateway will accept the [Ancient Key](/wiki/Ancient_Key "Ancient Key") to be placed again.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The Ruins were introduced in *[The Stuff of Nightmares](/wiki/Version_History#August_20.2C_2013_-_The_Stuff_of_Nightmares "Version History")* update.
* Since the release of the Ruins had to be pushed back, the [Slurper](/wiki/Slurper "Slurper") was made able to spawn in regular caves until *The Stuff of Nightmares* update, which made the Slurper a ruins-only creature, as intended.
* According to [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(character) "Maxwell (character)"), an over-use of [fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") from the [Nightmare Lights](/wiki/Nightmare_Light "Nightmare Light") led to the downfall of the [civilization](/wiki/Ancient_Civilization "Ancient Civilization") that once lived in the Ruins.
* Without mineral eating mobs like [Rock Lobsters](/wiki/Rock_Lobsters "Rock Lobsters") and [Slurtles](/wiki/Slurtles "Slurtles"), any minerals generated by earthquakes will amass over time. This can cause lag, if they aren't removed.
* Prior to the [Don't Starve Mega Update](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Mega_Update "Don't Starve Mega Update"), when using a [Teleportato](/wiki/Teleportato "Teleportato") in a *Hamlet* or *Shipwrecked* world, the Caves and Ruins would be erased and ready to regenerate.

## Mosquito Bugs[]

* When dying in the Caves or Ruins, exiting the game right at the moment of death will cause the Cave or Ruins world to reset. Upon reloading, the player will spawn in a new Cave or Ruins world and lose all items.
  + This bug can be exploited to make rare non-renewable items such as [Green Gems](/wiki/Green_Gem "Green Gem") and [Thulecite](/wiki/Thulecite "Thulecite") renewable without using the [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing") or [Seed of Ruin](/wiki/Seed_of_Ruin "Seed of Ruin"). This bug works only if the player doesn't have any resurrecting structures active.
