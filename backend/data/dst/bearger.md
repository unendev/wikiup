**Bearger** is one of the [Giants](/wiki/Giants "Giants") introduced in the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* DLC, representing the season of [Autumn](/wiki/Seasons/Autumn "Seasons/Autumn"). If the player starts in Autumn, Bearger will not spawn in the first season and will instead appear in the following year.

When killed, Bearger will drop 8 [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") and 1 [Thick Fur](/wiki/Thick_Fur "Thick Fur"), which can be used to craft the [Hibearnation Vest](/wiki/Hibearnation_Vest "Hibearnation Vest"), [Insulated Pack](/wiki/Insulated_Pack "Insulated Pack") and the [Polar Bearger Bin](/wiki/Polar_Bearger_Bin "Polar Bearger Bin").

## Behavior[]

### General[]

Bearger appears during [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn") while looking for [Food](/wiki/Food "Food") to eat. Bearger is particularly attracted to [Bee Boxes](/wiki/Bee_Box "Bee Box") and will be satiated by eating 10 [Honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey"), after which it will fall [asleep](/wiki/Asleep "Asleep"). However, it will prioritize fighting the player over eating Honey when provoked.

Bearger will eat any Food left on the ground, including [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms") and [Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries") from their plants, and destroy [Trees](/wiki/Trees "Trees") in its path as it moves about. If it happens upon a [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest") (including [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester")), it will rummage inside, tossing [Items](/wiki/Items "Items") to the ground while eating any Food it finds. When there is no Food in the area, Bearger will passively follow the player. Food stats affect Bearger the same way it would the player, meaning that healing Food will heal it for the same amount of Health while damaging Foods such as [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") will also lower its Health.

While Bearger's range of aggression is small, approaching it directly will cause it to increase its movement speed and attack the player. Additionally, it will be upset and issue a warning growl if the player picks up Food that it had intended to eat. The second time Food is taken, it will issue another warning growl. Stealing its Food a third time will incite Bearger to attack.

### Attacks[]

| **Attack** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| * Expand slideshow Attack animation * Expand slideshow Attack range  1/2 | Bearger will use a swipe attack at close range, dealing damage and knocking the weapon out of the player's hand. It will use this attack up to three consecutive times before using its slam attack. |
| * Expand slideshow Attack animation * Expand slideshow Attack range  1/2 | Once Bearger has used 3 swipes, it will slam the ground with its front paws, creating a shockwave that will demolish [Structures](/wiki/Structures "Structures"), fell Trees, and uproot [Plants](/wiki/Plants "Plants") in a large area as well as knock the player's weapon from their hand. This attack only does damage within Bearger's melee range, despite damaging objects at a larger distance. |
| https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/55/Beargerchardestroy.gif/revision/latest?cb=20220601004505 | If the player runs away from Bearger when it is about to do its slam attack, it will charge after the player, destroying objects in its path. When it either catches up to the player or has been running for long enough, it will use its slam attack. |

## Don't Starve Together Don't Starve Together[]

Bearger will no longer despawn.

Bearger will have twice as much Health (6000 compared to 3000).

Bearger will deal 87 damage to players (instead of 100) and 175 damage to mobs (instead of 200).

Bearger will not attack if simply approached, making it a neutral mob unless attacked or otherwise provoked (such as by Honey).

Bearger cannot be put to sleep using Honey and will automatically become hostile if a nearby player has a "honeyed" item in their inventory ([Honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey"), [Honeycomb](/wiki/Honeycomb "Honeycomb"), [Royal Jelly](/wiki/Royal_Jelly "Royal Jelly"), [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy"), [Pumpkin Cookies](/wiki/Pumpkin_Cookies "Pumpkin Cookies"), [Honey Nuggets](/wiki/Honey_Nuggets "Honey Nuggets"), [Honey Ham](/wiki/Honey_Ham "Honey Ham"), [Powdercake](/wiki/Powdercake "Powdercake") and [Jellybeans](/wiki/Jellybeans "Jellybeans")).

Bearger will hibernate during [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter") and [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring") and not periodically drop any [Fur Tufts](/wiki/Fur_Tuft "Fur Tuft"). During [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") and Autumn, it will behave as usual and periodically drop a Fur Tuft. Additionally, its ground pound attack has a 20% chance of dropping three Fur Tufts.

If put to sleep and then attacked, it will yawn while waking up, causing all players as well as mobs on screen to fall asleep. Bearger will then attack the player or mob that hit it first. During [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter") and [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"), Bearger will yawn multiple, unprompted times in combat. He may also try to fall back into his hibernation after a while, even if it is attacking an enemy.

Bearger first spawn on day 76-77 on default setting. Bearger takes 26 days and then 25%-31.25% of the remaining days in autumn to respawn.

## Strategy[]

### General Melee[]

* The player can attack Bearger 3-4 times before having to dodge, except after it slams the ground, as a swipe attack follows immediately after. Using [Roads](/wiki/Road "Road") or other means of [speed increase](/wiki/Category:Speed_Boost "Category:Speed Boost") for kiting may allow for a third hit if timed correctly.
* Equipping at least a [Log Suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit") or [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet") is recommended, keeping in mind that armor defense will only stack in *Don't Starve* and **not** in *Don't Starve Together*.
* Weapons may be knocked into the water when fighting Bearger near an ocean.
* Fighting Bearger in melee range could drain a player's sanity in a few minutes. This creates an additional hazard, especially when fighting after dusk, as [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures") may also attack.

### Burst Damage[]

One of the fastest ways to deal with any boss in *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* is a combination of immobilization and either the [Old Bell](/wiki/Old_Bell "Old Bell") or 14 [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder"). First, the player must immobilize Bearger by either freezing it with an [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff") or sedating it with [Sleep Darts](/wiki/Sleep_Dart "Sleep Dart") or a [Pan Flute](/wiki/Pan_Flute "Pan Flute"). A stack of 10 Honey may also be used to sedate Bearger, however it may need to be immobilized more than once, depending on how quickly the following tactics are used:

1. While frozen or asleep, a stack of 14 Gunpowder can be placed and lit directly beside Bearger. The 14 Gunpowder will bring Bearger down to 200 Health. The player can then finish the fight with 2 [Blow Darts](/wiki/Blow_Darts "Blow Darts") or 5-7 strikes with a [Spear](/wiki/Spear "Spear"). Using more Gunpowder will kill Bearger while it is on fire and potentially burn any dropped loot.
2. The Old Bell can defeat Bearger in three uses. Once immobilized, the player should ring the bell while standing directly beside Bearger, then run away. The stomping noises made by Bigfoot as it approaches will wake Bearger, requiring it to be sedated again if Honey, Sleep Darts, or a Pan Flute were used. The stomping will not unfreeze Bearger, however it may need to be re-frozen before Bigfoot's attack.

### Poisoning[]

Unlike other bosses, Bearger will eat any Food it sees and is affected by poisonous Foods (such as Red Mushrooms or Monster Meat). The player can lead Bearger to poisonous Foods or drop poisonous Foods on the ground and allow Bearger to damage itself without the player needing to attack.

One such method involves leading the Bearger into a [Marsh](/wiki/Marsh "Marsh") biome. Any [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacles "Tentacles") nearby will attack Bearger and be quickly defeated by Bearger's high damage, dropping a considerable amount of Monster Meat for Bearger to consume. Each piece of Monster Meat will deal 20 damage. Due to Bearger's high Health, relying on Monster Meat alone is not a very efficient method, and combination of different poisonous Foods and/or damage from hostile Mobs will be quicker.

### Other[]

* Another way to kill Bearger is to lure it into a forest and have it destroy trees, until one or more [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard") spawn. Since Treeguards move slowly, the player may need to lead Bearger into a position where the Treeguards can attack.
* When lit on fire using a [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff") or a [Fire Dart](/wiki/Fire_Dart "Fire Dart"), Bearger will panic and not attack the player. Lighting it several times can be a good way to deal large amounts of damage from a distance, though surrounding Items or Structures may also be ignited in the process.
* [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider") are not automatically hostile to Bearger, nor is Bearger automatically hostile to Spiders or [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den"). The player must manually incite either party in order to start a fight between them. This means that if the Bearger is killed near a Spider Den, there may still be Spiders around after the battle. If the player wants any meat dropped by a Bearger, they should retrieve the Bearger's loot before a Spider can reach it.
* In [Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together"), players can place a [Houndius Shootius](/wiki/Houndius_Shootius "Houndius Shootius") on a [Boat](/wiki/Boat "Boat") and anchor the boat offshore to kill Bearger without taking damage.

Below is the number of hits it takes with each weapon to kill a Bearger when playing with characters with a default damage modifier. The [Weather Pain](/wiki/Weather_Pain "Weather Pain") is not included due to the random nature of its projectile.

It takes 4 blasts to freeze a Bearger with an [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff") and 4 [Sleep Darts](/wiki/Sleep_Dart "Sleep Dart") to put to sleep.

## Tips[]

* Bearger can follow players through wormholes, nullifying the ability to retreat as Bearger will be able to strike the player before they manage to get up.
* Bearger will periodically teleport near the player if it has not fallen asleep.
* When enraged, Bearger is able to take down nearby trees. The player can use this to their advantage by leading Bearger through trees and collecting the dropped Logs afterwards, though the player must have enough speed boost to avoid being hit.
* If the player chooses to farm Logs safely while keeping Bearger alive, one must lead it to Birchnut Trees instead of Evergreen Trees, as it will defeat Poison Birchnut Trees much easier than it would Treeguards. This method will also provide a steady source of Living Logs, Twigs, and Birchnuts.

## Trivia[]

* Bearger and [Moose/Goose](/wiki/Moose/Goose "Moose/Goose") share the position of mob with the highest amount of Health points in *Reign of Giants*.
* Bearger's [Winter's Feast](/wiki/Winter%27s_Feast "Winter's Feast") appearance in *Don't Starve Together* resembles the [Yeti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti "wikipedia:Yeti") (also known as the Abominable Snowman), a mythical ape-like creature rumored to inhabit regions in the Himalayas.
* The name Bearger is a portmanteau of the words "Bear" and "Badger", as highlighted by Wilson's and Wanda's quote.
* Bearger's obsession with Food and its appearance in Autumn are both reflective of real life bears, who consume large amounts of food in the fall before hibernating in the winter.
  + Badgers, while they do not technically hibernate, also stock up on food in the fall and enter a state of *torpor* where they will sleep for around 29 hours to slow their metabolism and conserve energy.
  + Bearger's habit of rummaging through chests is also reflective of bears' tendency to break into trash cans and cars, among other things, in order to find food.
