**Sculptures** is a [filter](/wiki/Crafting#Crafting_Filter "Crafting") in the crafting menu for *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, introduced in *[A New Reign](/wiki/A_New_Reign "A New Reign")*. It allows the players to craft objects using the [Potter's Wheel](/wiki/Potter%27s_Wheel "Potter's Wheel"). Similar to the [Ancient Tab](/wiki/Ancient_Tab "Ancient Tab") and the [Ancient Pseudoscience Station](/wiki/Ancient_Pseudoscience_Station "Ancient Pseudoscience Station"), items under this Filter cannot be prototyped and then made on the go in the future; in order to craft an item under this Filter, the player must always be near a Potter's Wheel, no matter how many times the item has been crafted.
