Outwardly, it is a shadow butterfly. When cast, it's set underground like a fanged trap. If a creature enters the trap's range, the trap activates, frightening all creatures around it: creatures go into panic mode for 12 seconds. In this state, they cannot attack and start running aimlessly around the area, losing 1/3 of their movement speed. After being summoned, the trap stays charged for three in-game days, and then disappears. Does not react or interact with bosses.

The trap turns [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit"), [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman"), and [Splumonkeys](/wiki/Splumonkey "Splumonkey") into their shadow versions, which can be seen by the player at low [sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") or during a [Nightmare Cycle](/wiki/Nightmare_Cycle "Nightmare Cycle"), for the length of one day (8 minutes). Transformed creatures are guaranteed to drop one [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") on death. Also, under the influence of a trap, [Spider Gland](/wiki/Spider_Gland "Spider Gland") always drop from [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider").

The prison spell allows you to immobilize creatures within a certain radius for a while, imprisoning them in shadow columns. Depending on the type of creature, the duration of the trap also varies: 24 seconds for normal creatures, 12 seconds for bosses, and 6 seconds for other players in PVP mode. Imprisonment time is reduced if the trapped creature is attacked. Shadow Prison does not damage targets.
