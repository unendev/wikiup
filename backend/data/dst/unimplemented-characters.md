## Wilton[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/43/Wilton Portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20121227104403 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/43/Wilton Portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20121227104403 

Wilton's portrait.

 

**Wilton** is a skeleton character originally found in the files of *Don't Starve*. His model is identical to that of the skeleton [Boons](/wiki/Boon "Boon"), but Wilton's assets in the game predate them. It was once possible to spawn Wilton into the game with the code `"wilton"` and his portrait once appeared if the player reached the XP cap. His voice sounds were produced with bamboo.[[1]](#cite_note-recap-1)

Wilton was originally an iteration of [Woodlegs](/wiki/Woodlegs "Woodlegs"). He would have been able to transform into a skeleton, but the developers had trouble implementing the mechanic.[[2]](#cite_note-2)

Wilton would have used special character strings instead of a full speech file. These strings consist of the following:[[3]](#cite_note-3)

* "Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh."
* "Eeeeeeeeeeeer."
* "Rattle."
* "click click click click"
* "Hissss!"
* "Aaaaaaaaa."
* "mooooooooooooaaaaan."
* "..."

Known assets include:

* In-game character model
* Unlock portrait
* Silhouette
* Sound files
* In-game speech
* Map icon
* [Skull](/wiki/Unimplemented_Features#Player_Skulls "Unimplemented Features")

## Winnie[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/15/Winnie Portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20190126205952 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/15/Winnie Portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20190126205952 

Winnie's portrait.

 

**Winnie** is a young female character originally found in the files of *Don't Starve*. Kevin Forbes has described her as a "Little Bo-Peep kind of character" and suggested that she was planned to have perks related to animals and being a vegetarian.[[4]](#cite_note-4) Her facial features resemble [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") who was added as part of the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* DLC long after Winnie's assets were found in the game files. A yawning sound file for Winnie has been found in Wilson's audio files in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* since at least May 2015.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

She may be a reference to Winifred "Winnie" Foster from the book [*Tuck Everlasting*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuck_Everlasting "wikipedia:Tuck Everlasting") by Natalie Babbitt, because of her similar dress, shared name, and blonde hair.

Known assets include:

* In-game character model (Removed)
* Unlock portrait
* Silhouette
* Sound files
* Map icon (Removed)
* [Skull](/wiki/Unimplemented_Features#Player_Skulls "Unimplemented Features")

## Wallace[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/23/Wallace Portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20121227112134 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/23/Wallace Portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20121227112134 

Wallace's portrait.

 

**Wallace** is an older male character originally found in the files for *Don't Starve*. Developer Kevin Forbes has implied that he is Scottish.[Verification Needed]

Wallace's hairstyle may be a reference to the hairstyle of Dracula in the film *[Bram Stoker's Dracula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker%27s_Dracula "wikipedia:Bram Stoker's Dracula")*.

Known assets include:

* Unlock portrait
* Sound files

Waverly's portrait.

 

**Waverly** is a witch character originally found in the files for *Don't Starve*.

Her name may be a reference to the TV show *[Wizards of Waverly Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizards_of_Waverly_Place "wikipedia:Wizards of Waverly Place")*.

Known assets include:

* Unlock portrait
* [Skull](/wiki/Unimplemented_Features#Player_Skulls "Unimplemented Features")

## Pyro[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/8/80/Pyro Portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20140601141518 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/8/80/Pyro Portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20140601141518 

Pyro's portrait

 

The **Pyro** is a character discovered in the files for *Don't Starve* and is based off of the class of the same name from *[Team Fortress 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress_2 "wikipedia:Team Fortress 2")*. Pyro was originally put together by the development team for fun[[6]](#cite_note-6) and was not intended to be part of another promotion with Valve.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

There were special Pyro-related items found within the game's files, such as a Balloonicorn [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester"), an Axtinguisher, a Lollichop, a broken or bitten-into version of the Lollichop, and a Flare Gun. Different colour\_cube files were also found under the name insane\_pyro\_dusk.cc, insane\_pyro\_day.cc, and insane\_pyro\_night.cc, suggesting some form of "[Pyrovision](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Pyrovision)" when this character is played.

In the sound files, Pyro is called "wyro", much like how Maxwell is called "waxwell". This is because of the naming convention in which all playable characters' names begin with a "W".

Animation files for Pyro were also found in DS Newhome files.

Known assets include:

* Character poster
* Unlock portrait
* Sound files
* Animation files
* colour\_cube files
* Pyro-based items

## Watricia[]

**Watricia** is a character that was supposed to be implemented in the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* DLC, but was later scrapped in favor of [Wilbur](/wiki/Wilbur "Wilbur"). Her development only got as far as some concept art and prototyped game items before she was shelved.[[8]](#cite_note-8) The game items that were to be exclusive to her were [Rawling](/wiki/Rawling "Rawling") and a [Backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") called "mailpack" in her prefab file.[[9]](#cite_note-9) Before it was removed, her in-game speech file was empty.[Verification Needed]

Watricia's exclusive items being a Mail Pack and a basketball companion named Rawling seem to be references to the main character of the film *[Cast Away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast_Away "wikipedia:Cast Away")*, a marooned Fedex employee who makes a companion out of a volleyball he names Wilson.

Known assets include:

* In-game speech (Removed)
* Prefab file

## Mod player[]

Was found in Don't Starve Newhome beta files and was in Don't Starve Together files. In [Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together"), the icon is used as a placeholder for [modded](/wiki/Mods "Mods") characters on the world select screen where the character icon usually sits.

Known assets include:

* In-game character model
* Character filter icon (was added to Don't Starve Together files in 24 march 2022)

Frog Webber portrait

 

Frog Webber - A character with Webber's ability, but at the same time having additional features. He was able to jump with a cane. Maybe frogs wouldn't attack him. The parameters of health, hunger and sanity are the same as those of Webber. He was shown on one of the streams. The [mod with him](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=451023177) was later released by Klei for DST.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/29/WX-78 Sound File Woodrow Prefixes.png/revision/latest?cb=20190411003911 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/29/WX-78 Sound File Woodrow Prefixes.png/revision/latest?cb=20190411003911 

A screenshot of wx78.fsb that contains WX's sounds. Note how many of them are labeled "Woodrow".

 

* *Don't Starve* sound files for a character named Woodrow were found to be identical to WX-78's sound files. Most of WX-78's sound files still have the prefix "Woodrow", suggesting that Woodrow might have been either a development name for WX-78 or a completely different character that eventually evolved into WX-78.
* In the preview stream for the *[A Little Rain Must Fall](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve/Version_History "Don't Starve/Version History")* update, Klei Entertainment said that all of character sounds as of March 2013 were completed,[[1]](#cite_note-recap-1) although only some of them were in the files.
* On the subject of character unlocking, Kevin Forbes said: "I'm not against having a secret character unlock down in the depths of the cave, but it would probably end up being a more esoteric one, like Wortox or something else non-human".
* In 2015, the name "wepeatski" was found in the files for *Shipwrecked* along with Wastien (Warly's development name), Walani, Woodlegs and Watricia.[[10]](#cite_note-10) The name Wepeatski is most likely intended to be an easter egg as it is similar to the name Repeatski, a character from *[Super Time Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Time_Force "wikipedia:Super Time Force")* made by Capybara Games.
  + Wepeatski reappeared in the animation files for *Hamlet*, which includes a fan made character model from a mod for unknown reasons.[[11]](#cite_note-11)
* There is a silhouette in the game files of the *Shipwrecked* DLC that was thought to have been for an upcoming character, however during a PAX Prime demo stream for the DLC in 2015 the silhouette was presented as a "generic shadow" placeholder and "not necessarily a peek at a new character."[[12]](#cite_note-12)
* [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78"), [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom"), [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes"), [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell_(character) "Maxwell (character)") (for a short time), [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie"), [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber"), [Wilbur](/wiki/Wilbur "Wilbur"), [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba"), [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood"), [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox"), and [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff") were on this page before they were implemented.
  + Wortox was on this page for the longest amount of time (from December 2012 to March 2019) before eventually coming to *Don't Starve Together* as a DLC character.
  + Wortox is the only unimplemented character from *Don't Starve* to be introduced to *Don't Starve Together* without being a part of *Don't Starve*.
* Many characters listed here have been modded into the game by the community, including Wilton, Winnie, Waverly, Walace, and Pyro.
* In *Don't Starve Together*, a hotfix in March 2017 accidentally added speech files for [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona"), however, the files were quickly removed. On September 13th, 2017, Winona was officially added to the game.
* Pyro's sanity sounds are a refrence to "Pyroland" a imaginary place inside of the pyro's head, and other classes can see the same things by wearing "Pyrovision Goggles", here's a list of changes when wearing the goggles: Enemy death voice lines change, Explosions are now balloons, and the fire particles are turned into different rainbow colors.
