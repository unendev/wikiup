## Warbucks

Warbucks

Status

| Health | Hunger | Sanity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 150 | 120 | 200 |

### Sanity Modifier

-15 per food not prepared in a Crock Pot.

### Starting Item(s)

Magnifying Glass Ball Pein Hammer

### [Code](/wiki/Console "Console")

`"warbucks"`

Warbucks gains [sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") over time when he holds [Oincs](/wiki/Oinc "Oinc"). He gains, in a non-linear way, up to 40 Sanity per minute if there are up to 200 Oincs in the player's inventory. Holding more than 200 Oincs does not increase his Sanity regeneration further. He enters the Constant with a [Ball Pein Hammer](/wiki/Ball_Pein_Hammer "Ball Pein Hammer") and a [Magnifying Glass](/wiki/Magnifying_Glass "Magnifying Glass").

Because he is an explorer, his experience with treasure hunting tools allows him to consume only half the durability that is normally consumed for the [Ball Pein Hammer](/wiki/Ball_Pein_Hammer "Ball Pein Hammer"), [Magnifying Glass](/wiki/Magnifying_Glass "Magnifying Glass"), [Disarming Tools](/wiki/Disarming_Tools "Disarming Tools") and [Gold Pan](/wiki/Gold_Pan "Gold Pan").

The table below represents the exact number of sanity regenerated depending on the amount of Oincs held in the player's inventory as Warbucks.

| Oincs in inventory | Sanity per minute |
| --- | --- |
| 0-9 | 0 |
| 10-19 | 6.25 |
| 20-49 | 12.5 |
| 50-199 | 25 |
| 200 and more | 40 |

### Disadvantages[]

Warbucks loses 15 Sanity every time he eats [Food](/wiki/Food "Food") not prepared in a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot").

## Prototype Tips[]

* Making Crock Pot dishes is difficult at the beginning of the game, and when coupled with Warbucks' low maximum [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"), the player is in danger of either starving, or going insane quickly from eating unprepared food. Spending the first few days clearing the [Deep Rainforest](/wiki/Deep_Rainforest "Deep Rainforest") to collect the [Lost Relics](/wiki/Lost_Relics "Lost Relics") there, and then visiting the [Pig City](/wiki/Pig_City "Pig City") can give the player enough Tenpiece Oincs to easily survive before a Crock Pot is made.
* Warbucks' ability to regain Sanity by holding Oincs in the inventory allows him to manage it easily if the player has sufficient Oincs on hand. This is arguably even more useful than [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell/Character "Maxwell/Character")'s ability, as the player can chose to stop the sanity regeneration at any time, and control the rate at which it happens.
  + The downside is that this is a mid-game advantage since he starts with no Oincs.
