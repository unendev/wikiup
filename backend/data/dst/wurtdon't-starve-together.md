### Advantages[]

Wurt is able to craft the [Royal Tapestry](/wiki/Royal_Tapestry "Royal Tapestry"), facilitating the creation of the [King of the Merms](/wiki/King_of_the_Merms "King of the Merms") whose existence buffs the stats of all [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm"), [Loyal Merm Guards](/wiki/Merm/Guard "Merm/Guard"), and Wurt herself. Merms and Wurt players can tell the King is active by a change in physical appearance. By trading the King [Fishes](/wiki/Fishes "Fishes"), the player can receive [Kelp Fronds](/wiki/Kelp_Fronds "Kelp Fronds"), [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds"), specific [Crop Seeds](/wiki/Crop_Seeds "Crop Seeds"), [Cut Reeds](/wiki/Cut_Reeds "Cut Reeds"), [Tentacle Spots](/wiki/Tentacle_Spots "Tentacle Spots"), certain [Trinkets](/wiki/Trinkets "Trinkets"), and additionally [Gold Nuggets](/wiki/Gold_Nugget "Gold Nugget") if trading an [Ocean Fish](/wiki/Ocean_Fishes "Ocean Fishes").

She can also craft [Craftsmerm Houses](/wiki/Craftsmerm_House "Craftsmerm House"), which house Merms, and [Merm Flort-ifications](/wiki/Merm_Flort-ifications "Merm Flort-ifications"), which house Loyal Merm Guards. She can befriend Merms by feeding them, and they can help her fight, chop trees, and mine boulders. So as to not leave out any other players who are not Merms, she can craft a [Clever Disguise](/wiki/Clever_Disguise "Clever Disguise") for them to wear.

Wurt can craft [Marsh Turf](/wiki/Marsh_Turf "Marsh Turf"), which increases her movement speed when walked upon by [30%](/wiki/Player_Speed "Player Speed") (though this boost does not stack with that of [roads](/wiki/Road "Road")). She can also see where [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacles "Tentacles") are hiding.

Drowning in the [Ocean](/wiki/Ocean "Ocean") will only give Wurt 50% [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness"). She keeps her full inventory (except her hand item) and none of her stats are affected.

Wurt is immune to most effects of [wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness"); she won't lose sanity when being wet or equipping wet items and has a strong grip and so will not drop slippery items (she also won't lose held items due to [Moose/Goose](/wiki/Moose/Goose "Moose/Goose") honk or [Bearger](/wiki/Bearger "Bearger") attack). However she will still lose temperature when wet.

[Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnymen "Bunnymen") and other creatures that attack [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber") & [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox") are instead neutral with her. [Frogs](/wiki/Frog "Frog") are also neutral with Wurt as well as other Merms.

[Durians](/wiki/Durian "Durian") and [Kelp Fronds](/wiki/Kelp_Fronds "Kelp Fronds") (raw, cooked or dried) won't make her lose Health or Sanity when eaten. Furthermore, any [Vegetables](/wiki/Vegetables "Vegetables")/[Fruits](/wiki/Fruits "Fruits")/[Butterfly Wings](/wiki/Butterfly_Wings "Butterfly Wings") will give her 33% extra Hunger. This bonus applies to raw and cooked foods, as well as Crock Pot Dishes. [Durian](/wiki/Durian "Durian") is her favorite food and gives her +15 Hunger on top of the +33%, but that's still only 48.25 hunger, vs. 49.9 for a [Pumpkin](/wiki/Pumpkin "Pumpkin"). Other players can eat pumpkins and a cooked pumpkin gives +8 Health. Gardeners take note.

The [Seawreath](/wiki/Seawreath "Seawreath"), [Garland](/wiki/Garland "Garland") and [Milkmade Hat](/wiki/Milkmade_Hat "Milkmade Hat") have their sanity effects flipped when worn by Wurt.

Keeping a living [Fish](/wiki/Fish "Fish"), [Eel](/wiki/Eel "Eel"), [Ocean Fishes](/wiki/Ocean_Fishes "Ocean Fishes") or [Star-Sky](/wiki/Star-Sky "Star-Sky") in her inventory gives her 3.3 [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") per minute. Fish held by Wurt will stay alive longer, suffocating at a rate of 0.25, allowing ocean fish to live for up to 4 days, freshwater fish up to 12 days. The sanity increase doesn't stack if there is more than 1 live fish in the player's inventory. A dead fish in Wurt's inventory makes her lose 4.4 Sanity/min which is helpful in [Enlightenment](/wiki/Enlightenment "Enlightenment") areas like [Lunar Island](/wiki/Lunar_Island "Lunar Island") and the [Lunar Grotto](/wiki/Lunar_Grotto "Lunar Grotto"), especially because she the usual sanity reduction methods of eating raw meat or Kelp Fronds, or wearing a Seawreath won't lower her sanity.

Wurt can read [Books](/wiki/Books "Books"), but won't trigger their effect. Instead, she'll either gain or lose Sanity depending on the Book she reads:

| Books | Sanity change |
| --- | --- |
| Birds of the WorldOn TentaclesThe Angler's Survival GuideLux Aeterna Redux | +50 |
| The Everything EncyclopediaSleepytime StoriesOvercoming ArachnophobiaTempering TemperaturesLux AeternaPractical Rain Rituals | +33 |
| The End is NighApplied HorticultureHorticulture, AbridgedApplied SilviculturePyrokinetics ExplainedLunar GrimoireApicultural Notes | -33 |
| Horticulture, Expanded | -50 |

### Disadvantages[]

Because Wurt hates [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") and they hate her, they will attack her on sight. If she gives a Pig her Clever Disguise, they will become neutral but can't be befriended. She also cannot trade with the [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King").

Wurt can't eat any [Meats](/wiki/Meats "Meats") products or [Eggs](/wiki/Eggs "Eggs"). This includes Fish, but not [Butterfly Wings](/wiki/Butterfly_Wings "Butterfly Wings").

When she holds [Fish Meat](/wiki/Fish_Meat "Fish Meat"), [Fish Morsels](/wiki/Fish_Morsel "Fish Morsel"), or [Spoiled Fish](/wiki/Spoiled_Fish "Spoiled Fish"), she will lose 4.4 Sanity per minute.

## Prototype Tips[]

* Because of the unique thermal properties of the [Ice Bream](/wiki/Ice_Bream "Ice Bream") and [Scorching Sunfish](/wiki/Scorching_Sunfish "Scorching Sunfish"), Wurt can use her fish-prolonging abilities to remain cool or warm throughout the [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") and [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"). By cycling between 2-3 fish, Wurt will never have to warm or cool save for the fish suffocating if held for too long.
* In order to use the [DIY Royalty Kit](/wiki/Royal_Tapestry "Royal Tapestry"), the player has to wait for a Merm to take the position as the King then feed them.
* [Fist Full of Jam](/wiki/Fist_Full_of_Jam "Fist Full of Jam") and [Ratatouille](/wiki/Ratatouille "Ratatouille") are good alternatives to Meatballs for winter, as they can be prepared with one Berry/Vegetable and three [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice") providing 49.9 and 33.3 Hunger (after the 33% boost) respectively. Fist Full of Jam takes a while to rot, and with Wurt's hunger boost, Fist Full of Jam is a reliable dish for her.
* [Butter Muffin](/wiki/Butter_Muffin "Butter Muffin") is another good food for Wurt because of its cheap recipe a [Butterfly Wings](/wiki/Butterfly_Wings "Butterfly Wings"), 1 [vegetable](/wiki/Vegetable "Vegetable"), and 2 twigs.
* [Trail Mix](/wiki/Trail_Mix "Trail Mix") is a good early healing alternative requiring only one [Roasted Birchnut](/wiki/Roasted_Birchnut "Roasted Birchnut"), two [Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries"), and a [Twig](/wiki/Twig "Twig").
* Meat isn't entirely useless to Wurt. Meat can be converted into [Eggs](/wiki/Eggs "Eggs") which can be used as filler or to make [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder") from [Rotten Eggs](/wiki/Rotten_Egg "Rotten Egg").
* Players not planning on having a King or keeping it fed should usually build a Craftsmerm Hut instead of a Merm Flortification, since without the king, Merm guards have much less health and tentacle spots are hard to amass. For those more interested in amassing Merm armies over time to fight however it's better to keep the King alive and primarily make Flortifications for their more powerful Merm Guards.
* [Cactus](/wiki/Cactus "Cactus"), [Bull Kelp](/wiki/Bull_Kelp "Bull Kelp"), [Stone Fruit Bushes](/wiki/Stone_Fruit_Bush "Stone Fruit Bush"), [Mossy Vine](/wiki/Mossy_Vine "Mossy Vine") and [Banana Bushes](/wiki/Banana_Bush "Banana Bush") still grow during [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"). Once placed near base and collected in larger numbers some of these become excellent sources of year-round food and provide ingredients for other valuable dishes like [Figatoni](/wiki/Figatoni "Figatoni") and [Banana Pops](/wiki/Banana_Pop "Banana Pop"), [Shakes](/wiki/Banana_Shake "Banana Shake"), and [Daiquiris](/wiki/Frozen_Banana_Daiquiri "Frozen Banana Daiquiri").
* [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm") and [Loyal Merm Guards](/wiki/Loyal_Merm_Guard "Loyal Merm Guard") are excellent for fighting bosses such as [Bee Queen](/wiki/Bee_Queen "Bee Queen"). They can be easily befriended with [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") and [Kelp Fronds](/wiki/Kelp_Fronds "Kelp Fronds") which can be acquired by trading with [Merm King](/wiki/King_of_the_Merms "King of the Merms"). Loyal Merm Guards are also immune to Bee Queen's screech.
