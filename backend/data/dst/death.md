Wilson dying.

 

**Death** is one of the key elements in the game, and one of two ways the player can gain [Experience](/wiki/Experience "Experience") and unlock new [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters"), with the other being traveling to the next world via [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing"). Upon death, the player drops all their carried inventory, even if resurrected afterwards, but only permanent death will provide Experience. All deaths, permanent or otherwise, are recorded in the [Morgue](/wiki/Morgue "Morgue").

## Invulnerability[]

* [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang") is immune to all damage when changing forms with his special power. This can be used to the player's advantage to survive attacks that would've otherwise killed them (e.g. [Bigfoot](/wiki/Bigfoot "Bigfoot")'s stomp). This does not apply to damage resulting from eating certain Food though, and equipped pieces of [Armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor") will still lose [Durability](/wiki/Durability "Durability").
* Activation of the in-game portals listed will make characters invincible during transition: [Wooden Thing](/wiki/Wooden_Thing "Wooden Thing"), [Worm Hole](/wiki/Worm_Hole "Worm Hole"), [Sinkhole](/wiki/Sinkhole "Sinkhole"), [Maxwell's Door](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door"), [Seaworthy](/wiki/Seaworthy "Seaworthy"), or [Skyworthy](/wiki/Skyworthy "Skyworthy").
* Characters who are still in the reviving animation.
* [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba") who is still in state of turning into Werepig or back. Hamlet
* [Wheeler](/wiki/Wheeler "Wheeler") who is still dodging. Hamlet
* The [Living Artifact](/wiki/Living_Artifact "Living Artifact") provides you with invulnerability for 180 seconds when used, due to the 100% damage reduction and resistance to all negative effects. Hamlet

## Gift Icon Downloadable Content[]

In all [DLCs](/wiki/DLC "DLC"), if the player dies and resurrects, there will be a [Skeleton](/wiki/Skeleton "Skeleton") found at the spot where the death has occurred, except when the cause of death is drowning in SW. These DLCs introduce additional causes of death:

## Resurrection[]

There are currently four [Items](/wiki/Items "Items") that allow the player resurrect themselves upon death – [Life Giving Amulet](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet"), [Meat Effigy](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy"), [Touch Stone](/wiki/Touch_Stone "Touch Stone"), and a [Magic Flower](/wiki/Magic_Flower "Magic Flower"). [Woodie's](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie") Were-Beaver form will also automatically resurrect him upon the Log Meter reaching 0. When an item is used to revive, it is destroyed and cannot be used again. Resurrection incurs the following penalties:

* Health is set to 50
* Hunger is set to 2/3 of maximum
* Sanity is set to 1/2 of maximum
* Empty inventory (items can be found at the death point)

If not resurrected, the character and the generated world are permanently lost.

## Don't Starve Together icon Don't Starve Together[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, resurrection mechanics have changed. Players are no longer revived automatically if a reviving item is present in the world or in their inventory. Instead, they are turned into [Ghost Characters](/wiki/Ghost_Characters "Ghost Characters") (only in Survival or Endless [Mode](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Game_Modes "Don't Starve Together")), which can revive themselves using the [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern") (only in Endless Mode), a [Life Giving Amulet](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet"), a [Meat Effigy](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy"), a [Second Chance Watch](/wiki/Second_Chance_Watch "Second Chance Watch"), or a [Touch Stone](/wiki/Touch_Stone "Touch Stone"). Players can also be revived by another player using a [Telltale Heart](/wiki/Telltale_Heart "Telltale Heart"). Additionally, Wigfrid can resurrect up to two players with her [Warrior's Reprise](https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Songs#Warrior's_Reprise) battle song.

Resurrection via the Florid Postern (only in Endless mode) or with a Telltale Heart incurs a maximum-health penalty. To remove the maximum-health penalty, the player must use a [Booster Shot](/wiki/Booster_Shot "Booster Shot") for every death they received during the game.

*Don't Starve Together* introduces a death by picking a [Rose](/wiki/Flower#Rose "Flower") at extremely low health, similar to the Spiky Bush and Cactus of the original and *Reign of Giants,* and death by another player (when pvp is enabled).

When a player dies, a death announcement will appear on the top of the screen. The message will change depending on the character gender, cause of death and player name. For example:

* "[Player Name] was killed by [Cause of Death]. [He/She/They] became a spooky ghost!"
* By changing whether you become a ghost or pick another survivor (in the World Generation settings) can be used as a way to farm endless resources. For example, you can pick [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell"), who starts with his Codex Umbra and 6 [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel"), and drop his items on the ground. Then either find a way to die normally or wait for darkness. Once dead choose any survivor and you will have the Nightmare Fuel. Can be repeated. Works with almost every survivor (excluding [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly") and his portable crock pot and Wes and his Speed balloons.)

## Placeholder Trivia[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/0/0e/You are dead screen.png/revision/latest?cb=20130201121919 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/0/0e/You are dead screen.png/revision/latest?cb=20130201121919 

The "You are Dead" screen from older versions of *Don't Starve*.

 
 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/68/2015-11-27 00002.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151128175036 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/68/2015-11-27 00002.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151128175036 

The new Death Screen after the *All's Well That Maxwell* update.

 

* Death cries were changed in *[The End of The Beginning](/wiki/Version_History#April_20,_2013_-_The_End_of_the_Beginning.5B2.5D "Version History")* update. Now all characters have their own death cry, except Wes, who does not make any noise at all. Before the update, all Characters had the same death cry.
* Upon death in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"), all items from before the transition from [Sandbox](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode") to Adventure Mode will be kept, and no alteration will have been made to the world.
* Before the *All's Well That Maxwell* update, the game had a different death screen.
* In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78"), so far, is the only character to use the pronoun "They" in the death announcement.
  + This is due to the fact that they are non-binary.

## Mosquito Bugs[]

* If the player leaves the game (or the game crashes) while the death animation plays, the character will still be alive upon return to that save file, this only works if the player has a [Touch Stone](/wiki/Touch_Stone "Touch Stone") Activated or a [Meat Effigy](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy"), this is because when the death animation plays, the game instantly deletes the save file. However, the death will still appear in the [Morgue](/wiki/Morgue "Morgue").
