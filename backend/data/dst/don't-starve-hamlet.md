* [Fish](/wiki/Fish "Fish") have an alternate look, resembling carp.
* [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log") take on a white color.
* [Reeds](/wiki/Reeds "Reeds") take on a darker color.
* [Snakeskin](/wiki/Snakeskin "Snakeskin") and items crafted from it have an alternate look.
* [Ghosts](/wiki/Ghost "Ghost") are replaced with [Ancient Spirits](/wiki/Ancient_Spirit "Ancient Spirit").
* [Foliages](/wiki/Foliage "Foliage") can now be used in the [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot").
* [Raw Birchnuts](/wiki/Birchnut "Birchnut") can now be eaten by [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters").
* [Hound's Tooths](/wiki/Hound%27s_Tooth "Hound's Tooth"), [Stingers](/wiki/Stinger "Stinger") and [Doydoy Feathers](/wiki/Doydoy_Feather "Doydoy Feather") become tradable now.
* [Frogs](/wiki/Frog "Frog") can now be set on fire.

## Gift Icon Content from other DLCs[]

Since *Hamlet* is the third DLC released for *Don't Starve*, it relies on several mechanics that were introduced in the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* and *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* DLCs. Therefore these mechanics (and items/structures that are needed to deal with them) had to be included in *Hamlet* and are now also available to players who do not actually own *Reign of Giants* and/or *Shipwrecked*. These changes also affect default *Don't Starve* worlds that have been made compatible with or linked to *Hamlet* worlds.

Please note that this category is not meant to include *Reign of Giants* and/or *Shipwrecked* exclusive features that are indeed available in *Hamlet* worlds, but only to players who own all/both DLCs, such as the characters [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid") and [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber").

June 14, 2019 Rev. 343524  We've added a new Performance setting in Settings called Dynamic Asset Loading. It saves memory by loading certain data as needed, and unloading it when it’s not used for a while. Like most optimizations there’s a trade-off - while the dynamic loading decreases memory usage significantly it also means the game has to load assets in the background - depending on your hardware this may be noticeable.

Rev. 319878  **Latest patch here with an invitation to beta test some new features.**  We’ve been working on improving performance and have a few changes that should make things better. This should particularly help with severe lag in interiors. But some of the backend changes are larger than we are comfortable to just deploy. We have set up a beta branch that people can go to and help us test out the changes.  An added benefit of some of the changes, is that the interior system has opened up to the other worlds, not just Hamlet worlds. So if you bring the Key to the City, you can build a pig city in the forest or even on a tropical island. I’m sure there’s some interactions with all this stuff we haven’t predicted yet, so having some more people playing with it will be helpful.  We’ve also put player craftable doors in the home decor tab. Once you’ve build a door in your house, you can use a Construction Permit on it to create an attached room.  **To access the beta branch:**   * Go to the BETAS tab in the Don’t Starve Properties dialogue. * Enter the code: **dsinteriorbeta** and press the CHECK CODE button. * Select **hamet\_interors - Hamlet Interior upgrade beta** from the drop down. * Your game will then update to the new beta branch.   This branch uses separate save files from your regular base game. You can make a copy of your base game save files in the beta branch by using the console command: **TheSim:ImportSave()** Your save files will remain unchanged in your regular branch.  You can return to the regular branch by going to the same BETAS tab and selecting the drop down: **NONE - Opt out of all beta programs.**  Thank you in advance for everyone who heads in there to play. We plan to run the beta for 2 weeks if everything runs as planned.  **New Features**   * New craftable Vortex Cloak added.

This update focuses on making our new Hamlet characters more interesting for you to play, particularly when playing outside of the Hamlet world.  Wilba has inherited one of her father's more colourful characteristics, namely, she now carries the same curse that inflicts all of her father's family with dreaded werepigism. Also, all of pigkind from Hamlet's town pigs to those of ROG will now recognize her as the king's daughter, and pay her tribute in the form of gifts.  We weren't very happy with how Warbucks was working out. While trying to find ways to make him work, we decided that he just wasn't as interesting as we would like, and so we've made the decision to start from scratch. You can still continue your Warbucks saves as his files will not be removed from the game, but he will no longer be in the official lineup of starting characters.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

 File:Don%27t Starve Hamlet Announcement Trailer 

Don't Starve Hamlet Announcement Trailer

 

* The title of the DLC, *Hamlet*, has three meanings. It can refer to a village, be a pun on pigs (**Ham**let), or be a reference to [Shakespeare's play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet "wikipedia:Hamlet").
* The *Hamlet* DLC's release date was originally slated for Q1/Q2 2018. Early Access was originally planned to end April 2019.[[5]](#cite_note-5)
* When Steam implemented the new wishlist feature in February 2018, they accidentally added the private estimated release date for *Hamlet*, March 20, 2018, instead of the public date of Q1/Q2 2018.[[6]](#cite_note-6) This was soon corrected.
* The first *Hamlet* exclusive character was [Warbucks](/wiki/Warbucks "Warbucks"), who was added during the DLC's beta. He was later retired from the DLC in Early Access update 307715. His files were kept in the game, and pre-existing saves with him would not change. In the update post on the forums, Klei gave their reasoning for removing him: "We weren't very happy with how Warbucks was working out. While trying to find ways to make him work, we decided that he just wasn't as interesting as we would like, and so we've made the decision to start from scratch with a new character."[[7]](#cite_note-7)
* In the trailer, Wilson is seen riding a hot air balloon. This is reminiscent of a piece of concept art from the [Forbidden Knowledge Trailer Puzzle](/wiki/Forbidden_Knowledge_Trailer_Puzzle "Forbidden Knowledge Trailer Puzzle").
* The setting is inspired by Monteverde, Costa Rica.[[8]](#cite_note-8)
* In the earliest announcement post, the DLC's official description was given as "Wilson has found the portal to the origins of the Pigmen, and he’s off to explore their civilization. There may be some bushwhacking and tomb raiding involved, too."[[1]](#cite_note-2017Announcement-1)

So in steam, we have 2 places to put a date, a public date and an estimated non-public date. We have March 20 as the internal private date. That was an estimation set a long long time ago when the project was first started. (I wasn't even aware of this date as it's basically a placeholder). It looks like Valve accidentally used this date when they rolled out the new wishlists and then quickly corrected it after that. Sorry for all the confusion there." Posted on February 16, 2018.
