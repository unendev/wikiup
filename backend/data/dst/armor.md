* [Don't Starve](#)
* [Don't Starve Together](#)

**Armor** is any in-game [Item](/wiki/Items "Items") that mitigates damage and protects the character from harm. It works by absorbing a portion of incoming damage in place of the wearer's (character or mob) [Health](/wiki/Health "Health"). Note that an armor's [Durability](/wiki/Durability "Durability") is decreased every time it blocks damage.

## Calculations[]

When the character or mob is wearing **both** chest armor and head armor, the total received damage would be distributed as follows:

1. Initial damage is absorbed by the *primary armor*.
2. Leftover damage is absorbed by the *secondary armor*.
3. Unabsorbed damage is then subtracted from the character's or mob's Health.

It is difficult to tell without getting hit first or using a mod which item is designated as primary or secondary armor. Re-equipping them or reloading the game *can* change this order. The damage subtracted from the character's Health is the same despite the order.

Example: Attack damage of a [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen") (80) to a character or mob equipped with a Grass Suit (*primary armor*) and a Football Helmet(*secondary armor*) will be distributed as follows:

* 80 × 60% = 48 damage is absorbed by the Grass Suit
* (80 − 48) × 80% = 25.6 damage is absorbed by the Football Helmet
* 80 − 48 − 25.6 = 6.4 damage is subtracted from the character or mob's Health

Calculation can be simplified to: 80 × (1 − 60%) × (1 − 80%) = 6.4

In a generic form:

`damage * (1 - primary armor) * (1 - secondary armor) = damage taken`

Note that the damage taken does not change when the primary and secondary values are switched, only how durability is lost is affected.

## Primary & secondary armor[]

The game itself does not distinguish any sort of pre-defined priorities of armor, instead takes them on the fly. While it might be hard to keep track of what armor receives the most damage, it is manageable.

Primary armor, i.e. the armor that absorbs the most damage, is always the last equipped. In order to save one's helmet, they would equip the helmet first, then the suit. If a suit is hot switched (replaced right away) it keeps its position. However, if there is any moment in which the helmet slot is empty (occurs when a helmet breaks, even if the player has a replacement in their inventory), the helmet assumes the primary slot and the suit has to be re-equipped.

It has been reported that reloading the game could change the positions. If not sure what armor is primary, just unequip the suit and equip it again, and the suit will become the primary.

Keep in mind that even the most beaten up log/grass suit still retains its original fuel value, therefore does not have to be used up. Instead of heading into the battle with an armor with low durability, risking the helmet assuming primary slot mid-fight, try equipping the shiny new suit and leaving the old one for when the night comes.

**Armor** is a type of in-game [Item](/wiki/Items "Items") that mitigates damage and protects the character from harm. It works by absorbing a portion of incoming hit damage in place of the wearer's (character or mob) [Health](/wiki/Health "Health"). And loses [Durability](/wiki/Durability "Durability") based on damage it blocked.

Armor generally has two stats called **Protection** and **Planar Defense**, which distribute (general) [Damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") and [Planar Damage](/wiki/Planar_Damage "Planar Damage") by hit for the [Mob](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") or [Character](/wiki/Characters "Characters") they are equipped with.

Note that armor can only share physical Damage and Planar Damage, other sources of damage such as [Food](/wiki/Food "Food"), [Fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire"), [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing"), [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") or [Crafting](/wiki/Crafting "Crafting") cannot be absorbed by armor. And armor isn't the only way to reduce health losses.

## Calculations[]

### Protection[]

1. Armor absorbs physical damage from hits **equal proportion** to their Protection value.
2. If wearing more than one piece of armor, only the highest Protection value is taken into account.
3. Damage is split among all of the worn armors, weighed by their Protection value.
4. Unabsorbed physical damage is then subtracted from the character's or mob's Health, subject to further damage reduction from sources like [Garlic Powder](/wiki/Garlic_Powder "Garlic Powder") or [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid "Wigfrid")'s natural defense.

`Damage Taken = Physical Damage * (1 - Highest Protection)`

### Planar Defense[]

Attention: Planar Defense is not [Planar Entity Protection](/wiki/Planar_Entity_Protection "Planar Entity Protection")!

1. Armor absorbs Planar Damage from hits **equal quantity** to their Planar Defense value.
2. Damage is evenly distributed to each armor until it reaches the Planar Defense they have.
3. Unabsorbed planar damage is then subtracted from the character's or mob's Health.

`Damage Taken = Planar Damage - Sum of all Planar Defense`

For mobs that deal a low amount of planar damage, such as the [Grazer](/wiki/Grazer "Grazer"), the amount of planar damage dealt can be reduced into the negatives with this formula. A negative amount of total planar damage received simply means the target takes no planar damage.

### Example[]

**Example:** Attack damage of a [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen") (80 general + 0 planar) to a character equipped with a Grass Suit and a Football Helmet will be distributed as follows:

* 60% ＜ 80%
* 80 × 80% = 64 damage is absorbed by two armor
  + 64 \* 60%/(80%+60%) ≈ 28 is absorbed by Grass Suit
  + 64 \* 80%/(80%+60%) ≈ 37 is absorbed by Football Helmet
* 0+0 = 0 planar damage is absorbed by two armor
  + 0 planar damage is absorbed by Grass Suit
  + 0 planar damage is absorbed by Football Helmet
* (80 − 64) + (0 - 0) = 16 damage is take by the character's Health

**Another example:** Attack damage of a [Rasp](/wiki/Rasp "Rasp") (20 general + 20 planar) to a character equipped with a Brightshade Armor and a Dreadstone Helm will be distributed as follows:

* 80% ＜ 90%
* 20 × 90% = 18 damage is absorbed by two armor.
  + 18 \* 80%/(90%+80%) ≈ 8.47 is absorbed by Brightshade Armor
  + 18 \* 90%/(90%+80%) ≈ 9.53 is absorbed by Dreadstone Helm
* 10+5 = 15 planar damage is absorbed by two armor.
  + 10 planar damage is absorbed by Brightshade Armor
  + 5 planar damage is absorbed by Dreadstone Helm
* (20 − 18) + (20 - 15) = 7 damage is take by the character's Health

### True durability[]

**`True durability = Armor durability * 100 / Armor protection.`**

True durability is the amount of total damage you can receive before your armor breaks. While durability of the armor is a good representation of how much the armor protects you it can be deceptive when it comes to how long will the armor actually last.

**Example:** [Thulecite suit](/wiki/Thulecite_Suit "Thulecite Suit") has 1260 durability, [Scalemail](/wiki/Scalemail "Scalemail") has 945 durability. This would lead you to believe Scalemail breaks a lot faster, however their protection values are different. When using True Durability you can actually see that the will last about the same amount of time. To break the Scalemail a [spider](/wiki/Spider "Spider") needs to hit you 68 times. To break the Thulecite suit it will take him 70 hits, even though the suit has 33% more durability.

Thulecite Suit- 1400 (1260 \*100/90)

Scalemail - 1350 (945 \*100/70)

Of course the amount of health lost with this armor on is also different. After breaking the Thulecite suit your HP will be down by 140, but using the Scalemail you will have lost over 400 HP. True durability can a be a good metric to plan out you use of armor. For example farming spiders with plenty of healing food you should opt for a more efficient armor with higher True durability to efectively use your resources. On the other hand when fighting bosses or playing a low health character like [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Maxwell/Don't Starve Together") or [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes") you might need the higher protection values.

**Another** **Example:** [Dragon fly](/wiki/Dragonfly "Dragonfly") deals 75 damage per hit, Log Suitand Football Helmethave total 786 true durability (315 \* 100 / 80 (393) + 315 \* 100 / 80 (393))

786/75=11 hits from [dragon fly](/wiki/Dragonfly "Dragonfly") will break this armor. Thulecite Suithas exactly double the durability of these two, but will only take 19 hits to break. This means that two Log Suit and two Football Helmet will actually give you protection for 3 extra hits, but will require you to heal a bunch of times to survive the 300 dmg done to you. On the other hand Thulecite Suit will break sooner, but a few characters should even be able to survive until then without needing any healing at all since only 140 dmg will be done to you.
