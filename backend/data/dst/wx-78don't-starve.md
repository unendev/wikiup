## Advantages[]

WX-78 is able to eat stale and spoiled Food without the related penalties, though is not immune to *all* Food penalties (such as eating [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat")). This allows them to stockpile food for increased lengths of time.

In both the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* *Shipwrecked* and *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")* *Hamlet* DLCs, WX-78 is immune to [Poison](/wiki/Poison "Poison"). However, WX-78 will still take damage from the [Gas Rainforest](/wiki/Gas_Rainforest "Gas Rainforest"). Since WX-78 is immune to poison damage, eating a [Venom Gland](/wiki/Venom_Gland "Venom Gland") will cure poison *without* dealing the usual 75 damage.

### System Overload[]

WX-78 glowing during the evening after being struck by lightning.

 

After being struck by [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning"), WX-78 will enter System Overload and receive the following benefits:

* Movement speed is increased by 50%.
* WX-78 emits Light (the radius of which diminishes gradually near the end of the Overload).
* Immunity to [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing").

WX-78 will lose 33 Sanity and gain 100 Health for each Lightning Strike that targets them. (Note: When using the [Telelocator Staff](/wiki/Telelocator_Staff "Telelocator Staff"), WX-78 takes the normal sanity loss on the takeoff and landing strikes, plus sanity lost for using the staff, but does not receive any health bonus.) WX-78 can be struck multiple times after System Overload has been activated. System Overload lasts for 0.75 [Days](/wiki/Day "Day") and can be stacked from multiple strikes to last for many days. This can be useful for survive freezing in the winter and fending off Charlie at night. Being near a [Lightning Rod](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod") or wearing items that protect from Lightning will prevent WX-78 from being struck. It should be noted that it is possible to set nearby objects and [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") on [Fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire") when struck by Lightning.

### Gear Upgrading[]

WX-78 is capable of ingesting Gears and thereby upgrading their stats, alongside a hefty stat recovery of 60 Sanity 75 Hunger and 50 Health.

## Disadvantages[]

WX-78 has some of the lowest starting maximum stats of any Character in *Don't Starve* leaving them exposed to danger until Gears are found.

Without DLC, WX-78 takes damage from Rain, at a rate of 0.5 every 3–5 seconds. With DLC, the addition of the Wetness mechanic modifies the way WX-78 is damaged by rain. Without any protective equipment, with any amount of wetness above 0, WX-78 will take a maximum damage of 0.5 Health every 3-5 seconds. Rain-Protective equipment will reduce this damage an amount equivalent to their percentage of rain resistance. For example, damage will be reduced by 50% while a 50% Rain resistant item is equipped (I.E. the Pretty Parasol), taking only 0.25 damage every 3-5 seconds for as long as WX-78 remains wet.

Rain damage causes WX-78 to periodically emit Light as sparks fly off their body. The light emitted is frequent and bright enough to prevent [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") from attacking, but comes at the cost of large amounts of Sanity due to being in complete darkness.

## Tips[]

* WX-78 acts like a [Lightning Rod](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod"). If any event launches multiple lightning strikes, such as coming to close to a [Thundernest](/wiki/Thundernest "Thundernest") with a [Thunderbird](/wiki/Thunderbird "Thunderbird") in Hamlet, **all** strikes will usually target WX-78.
* Equipping an [Umbrella](/wiki/Umbrella "Umbrella") alongside a hat that offers at least 10% rain protection (such as the [Straw Hat](/wiki/Straw_Hat "Straw Hat")) will completely shield WX-78 from Rain, preventing any damage from being taken.
  + WX-78 players may want to avoid using items that offer Lightning immunity (such as the Umbrella or [Eyebrella](/wiki/Eyebrella "Eyebrella")) if they require healing, though they will take a hit to their Sanity with each strike.
* Using the [Ice Cube](/wiki/Ice_Cube "Ice Cube") or [Fashion Melon](/wiki/Fashion_Melon "Fashion Melon") as protection from [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") is not advised, as the Wetness gained from those items will damage WX-78.
* WX-78's gear consumption ability makes them one of the better equipped characters for traversing the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins").
* Since they ignore spoilage and food loses all sanity restoration as soon as it turns stale, WX-78 players have at least double the time to utilize foods that grant high sanity but spoil quickly, giving them a distinct advantage over other characters in terms of sanity management.
