**Insight** is an in-game point system used to progress Skill Trees for following [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") in [Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together"):

* [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Skill_Tree "Wilson/Don't Starve Together")
* [Willow](/wiki/Willow/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Skill_Tree "Willow/Don't Starve Together")
* [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Skill_Tree "Wolfgang/Don't Starve Together")
* [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Skill_Tree "Woodie/Don't Starve Together")
* [Wigfrid](/wiki/Wigfrid/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Skill_Tree "Wigfrid/Don't Starve Together")
* [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Skill_Tree "Wormwood/Don't Starve Together")
* [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Skill_Tree "Wurt/Don't Starve Together")
* [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona")

These Characters can gain Insight Points and use them to unlock unique Skills. Insight Points are awarded after a number of days survived as the character, up to 15 total points after 68 days. Insight persists between games/worlds, as it is linked to a player's account. Note that time as a [Ghost](/wiki/Ghost_Characters "Ghost Characters") does not count toward gaining Insight Points.

There are more Skills to select from than total available Insight, meaning the player must deliberate between which Skills are to be unlocked. A character's unlocked Skills are reset on joining a new world/server, and can be reset in-game via using a [Moon Rock Idol](/wiki/Moon_Rock_Idol "Moon Rock Idol") on the [Celestial Portal](/wiki/Celestial_Portal "Celestial Portal") in an existing world, allowing players to unlock different skills if they wish.

| Skill | Description | Prerequisites |
| Lunar Cultivator I Lunar Cultivator I | Tap into your lunar roots to transform [Carrots](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot") into [Carrats](/wiki/Carrat "Carrat") for 3 days. It costs 1 Carrot and 5 HP to summon 1 Carrat. You can have up to 4 Carrats at the same time. They gather and give Wormwood a majority of edible items from the ground in a radius of 5 tiles from Wormwood as long as inventory slots are available (Ignores things like [Light Bulb](/wiki/Light_Bulb "Light Bulb") / [Powdercake](/wiki/Powdercake "Powdercake") / [Birchnuts](/wiki/Birchnut "Birchnut")).  It's possible to unsummon a Carrat by attacking it. This action does not cause [Soul](/wiki/Soul "Soul") to drop for a nearby [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox"). When a summoned Carrat dies or is unsummoned, it drops a Carrot. [Catcoons](/wiki/Catcoon "Catcoon") are hostile to Carrats and will kill them in one hit. Carrats are vulnerable to fire damage, and if ignited they drop a Roasted Carrot upon death. | * Learn at least **5 Left-Branch skills** to unlock. * Find and defeat the [Celestial Champion](/wiki/Celestial_Champion "Celestial Champion") |
| Lunar Cultivator II Lunar Cultivator II | Tap into your lunar roots to transform [Light Bulbs](/wiki/Light_Bulb "Light Bulb") into [Bulbous Lightbugs](/wiki/Bulbous_Lightbug "Bulbous Lightbug") for 2.5 days. It costs 1 Light Bulb and 10 HP to summon 1 Bulbous Lightbug. You can have up to 6 Bulbous Lightbugs at the same time. 1 Bulbous Lightbug is enough to not die to [Darkness](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") and 2 will completely negate sanity loss from it.  They keep an orbit at a distance of around 1.4 tiles away from Wormwood, circling counterclockwise. Despite their fast movement speed, it's still possible to outrun them and end up in the darkness—especially in the Caves, where the edge of the world can prevent them from properly following Wormwood.  It's possible to unsummon a Lightbug by attacking it, though not without a ranged weapon. [Catcoons](/wiki/Catcoon "Catcoon") are hostile to Bulbous Lightbugs and will kill them in one hit. Bulbous Lightbugs are vulnerable to fire damage and if ignited they drop [Ashes](/wiki/Ashes "Ashes") upon death. | Lunar Cultivator I |
| Lunar Cultivator III Lunar Cultivator III | Tap into your lunar roots to transform [Dragon Fruit](/wiki/Dragon_Fruit "Dragon Fruit") into [Saladmander](/wiki/Saladmander "Saladmander") for 2 days. It costs 1 Dragon Fruit and 25 HP to summon 1 Saladmander. You can have up to 2 Saladmanders at the same time.  Summoned Salamanders have 600 health (900 health if two summoned), regenerate health at a rate of 5 HP every 2.5 seconds (outside of the battle) and deal an average damage of 40 at all times. An important distinction to wild Saladmanders, which have 900 health and deal 30 damage by default and 50 damage when ripe.  Salamanders will engage in combat if their owner targets an enemy (as long as they are in a radius of 3 tiles away from the enemy), if an enemy damages their owner or if they are attacked themselves.  They will try to flee and follow if the owner is at least 4 tiles away from the enemy, but won't forget their target until the owner is at least 5 tiles away and a couple of seconds have passed.  It's possible to unsummon a Saladmander by attacking it. When a summoned Saladmander dies or is unsummoned, it drops a Dragon Fruit. | Lunar Cultivator I |
| Lunar Guardian I Lunar Guardian I | Seize foes and keep them rooted in place while wearing [Brightshade Armor](/wiki/Brightshade_Armor "Brightshade Armor"). Fuse Bramble Husks with Brightshade Armor to create [[Brambleshade Armor]. | * Learn at least **5 Right-Branch** **skills** to unlock. * Find and defeat the [Celestial Champion](/wiki/Celestial_Champion "Celestial Champion") |

## Tips[]

* One only need to kill the celestial champion/ancient fuelweaver with one character and this will unlock the corresponding affinity to all characters.
* To gain the Insight Points faster, PC players can use [Console Commands](/wiki/Console/Don%27t_Starve_Together_Commands "Console/Don't Starve Together Commands") to either skip the days, or they can use this command:

  ```
  TheSkillTree:AddSkillXP(10000, "wilson")
  ```

  (instead of "wilson" you can write any character name you want all Insight Points for - for Maxwell use "waxwell", for Wigfrid "wathgrithr").
  + As console players cannot use Console Commands to gain Insight Points faster, they can keep the game open with certain settings to gain the points without actively playing. As an example for the Switch: Keep your console plugged in and on relaxed mode, put a cloth under it to muffle any vibration from hunger damage, turn off all non autumn-seasons and keep it to day only, and leave it overnight. Your character’s health will remain at 30.
