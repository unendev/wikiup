**Wavey Jones** is a [Shadow Creature](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") exclusive to *Don't Starve Together* introduced in *[Return of Them](/wiki/Return_of_Them "Return of Them")*. A Wavey Jones spawns on the ocean in place of Night Hands, appearing for players with sanity below 75%. It attaches to the border of a boat and spawns two hands on the deck.

The two hands try to raise [Anchors](/wiki/Anchor_Kit "Anchor Kit") and [Masts](/wiki/Mast "Mast") and lower [Winged Sails](/wiki/Winged_Sail "Winged Sail"). If a player on the boat has less than 50% sanity they also try to extinguish [Fires](/wiki/Fire "Fire"). If a player has less than 25% sanity they also try to remove [Boat Patches](/wiki/Boat_Patch "Boat Patch") and [Trusty Tapes](/wiki/Trusty_Tape "Trusty Tape"). Removed Boat Patches create a small leak, 50 hull damage and drops 1 Boat Patch. Removed Trusty Tapes create a small leak and drop a Trusty Tape.

Players can stay close to the hands to force them to retract briefly. Wavey Jones's body will be driven off by the proximity of a player, but will reappear 10 seconds later. Wavey Jones disappears completely after being driven off for the third time or when daylight appears. When it spawns, it will make a eerie violin-like sound, changing each time it spawns.
