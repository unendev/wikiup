–[Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda"), when examining a Reanimated Skeleton.

The "forest" type is spawned by using a [Shadow Atrium](/wiki/Shadow_Atrium "Shadow Atrium") on a fully completed [Odd Skeleton](/wiki/Odd_Skeleton "Odd Skeleton") on the [Surface](/wiki/Surface_World "Surface World") during [Night](/wiki/Night "Night"). When spawned it does not attack and instantly reduces the player's [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") by 40. It can be attracted by the [Shadow Thurible](/wiki/Shadow_Thurible "Shadow Thurible"). When killed, it drops a [Shadow Atrium](/wiki/Shadow_Atrium "Shadow Atrium") and 8 [Fossils](/wiki/Fossils "Fossils"). It will die at the beginning of the [Day](/wiki/Day "Day").

### Behavior[]

The Reanimated Skeleton walks around aimlessly, destroying any structures it walks through, and leaves a trail of [Lesser Glow Berries](/wiki/Lesser_Glow_Berry "Lesser Glow Berry"), [Light Flowers](/wiki/Light_Flower "Light Flower"), and [Ferns](/wiki/Ferns "Ferns"). The plants will disappear after a few seconds. When idle, its arm will fall off and it will heal itself with its other arm. After dropping its arm twice it will grab its head and shake it furiously due to the long distance it has from the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins").

The "caves" type is spawned by using a [Shadow Atrium](/wiki/Shadow_Atrium "Shadow Atrium") on a fully completed Odd Skeleton in the [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves"). When spawned it is aggressive to the player and instantly reduces the player's Sanity by 40. It can be attracted by the [Shadow Thurible](/wiki/Shadow_Thurible "Shadow Thurible"). When killed, it drops a [Shadow Atrium](/wiki/Shadow_Atrium "Shadow Atrium"), 8 [Fossils](/wiki/Fossils "Fossils"), and 2-4 [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel").

### Behavior[]

The Reanimated Skeleton attacks by ripping off its head and swiping at an enemy; this does not have any AoE but will hit anything in the direction it is attacking. After its health has been decreased significantly, it will slam the ground trapping multiple players and other creatures in a fence of sharp bones. The bones will turn to dust after a few seconds.

**“**This was a VERY bad idea.**”**

–[Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda"), when examining the Ancient Fuelweaver.

The "Ancient Fuelweaver" type is spawned using a [Shadow Atrium](/wiki/Shadow_Atrium "Shadow Atrium") on a fully completed Odd Skeleton in the [Atrium](/wiki/Atrium "Atrium") near when the [Ancient Key](/wiki/Ancient_Key "Ancient Key") is in the [Ancient Gateway](/wiki/Ancient_Gateway "Ancient Gateway") and will instantly reduce the player's Sanity by 40. Its quotes imply that it was a being from the [Ancient Civilization](/wiki/Ancient_Civilization "Ancient Civilization").

Following its defeat, the Ancient Gateway will start to destabilize, consuming the Ancient Key and killing all nearby Shadow Creatures. After 4 minutes, the [ruins regenerate](/wiki/Ruins#Regeneration "Ruins"). The gate will have a recharge time of 20 days before being able to insert another Ancient Key.

If the player leaves the fight, then the Ancient Fuelweaver will decay, leaving behind 8 Fossils, 2-4 Nightmare Fuel, and a [Shadow Atrium](/wiki/Shadow_Atrium "Shadow Atrium").

### Behavior[]

---

The Ancient Fuelweaver will immediately start chasing and attacking the player, it will confine the player in a bone cage if the player is too far away. In different stages, it will spawn multiple [Woven Shadows](/wiki/Woven_Shadow "Woven Shadow") that it will eat to regain health.

The Ancient Fuelweaver has two stages:

**Stage 1 (Health 16000-10000)**

The Ancient Fuelweaver can snare its target like the Caves Reanimated Skeleton does.

The Ancient Fuelweaver can spawn Fossil Spikes to attack enemies.

**Stage 2 (Health 10000-0)**

The Ancient Fuelweaver has all skills from Stage 1 and the following skills:

Dozens of Woven Shadows will be spawned from the Ancient Floor with only 1 health. Woven Shadows will walk to the Ancient Fuelweaver. A Woven Shadow will heal the Ancient Fuelweaver for 400 health when the Ancient Fuelweaver eats it. Woven Shadows are immune to [Fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire") and [Freezing](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff").

A Shadow Shield will be spawned by 6 Unseen Hands around the [Ancient Gateway](/wiki/Ancient_Gateway "Ancient Gateway") to protect the Ancient Fuelweaver, which blocks 100% of incoming damage. The Shadow Shield will be broken when all Unseen Hands are destroyed. The Unseen Hands have 1 health and are only attackable by [Insane](/wiki/Insane "Insane") players.

The Ancient Fuelweaver can Mind Control insane players for 3.5 seconds. This can be avoided by restoring Sanity quickly once the [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures") appear.

If a player telepoofs out of the Atrium's arena or gets killed, the Fuelweaver will pull the key out of the Ancient Gateway and disassemble into the normal skeleton drops, while saying *"Please"*.

**Defeating**

When defeated, the Ancient Fuelweaver leaves behind 8 Fossils, 2-4 Nightmare Fuel, the [Shadow Thurible](/wiki/Shadow_Thurible "Shadow Thurible"), the [Bone Helm](/wiki/Bone_Helm "Bone Helm") and [Bone Armor](/wiki/Bone_Armor "Bone Armor"), and a single planted [Rose](/wiki/Flower#Don't_Starve_Together "Flower").

In addition to his death, the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") will begin to [regenerate](/wiki/Ruins#Regeneration "Ruins"), and after 4 minutes players are able to collect once exhausted resources from the ruins again.

As the Ruins begin to regenerate, a Beckoning Hand, visually identical to a [Night Hand](/wiki/Shadow_Creature#Night_Hand "Shadow Creature"), will appear in the Fuelweaver arena until the regeneration is complete. Giving 5 [Dreadstone](/wiki/Dreadstone "Dreadstone") to this hand will begin the [Shadow Rift Cycle](/wiki/Shadow_Rifts "Shadow Rifts") in the Caves.

## Prototype Tips[]

The difficulty of the Ancient Fuelweaver fight, as with most bosses, exponentially lowers with player count, and typically 4-5+ players will make the fight substantially easier. The tips below assume a player count of 1-3 players of around average skill, and as a result some suggested preparations may be overkill with more players or depending on individual player skill.

* The bone cage attack is arguably the most powerful attack in Ancient Fuelweaver's arsenal, as it denies ensnared players from dealing with other important factors in the fight. As such, making preparations to counter it can mean the difference between winning and losing the fight.
  + [The Lazy Explorer](/wiki/The_Lazy_Explorer "The Lazy Explorer")/[Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda")'s [Backstep Watch](/wiki/Backstep_Watch "Backstep Watch")/[Wortox](/wiki/Wortox/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Wortox/Don't Starve Together")’s Soul Hop can free the player from the cage. This can be crucial to success, as it can prevent the player from taking too much damage from Fuelweaver while trapped or can let them more easily kill Woven Shadows before they are consumed.
    - If the player is using Lazy Explorers, they should decide on whether it is better to use it or to wait until the bone cage expires. Using it every single time they become trapped will quickly exhaust it all of its charges. The sanity drain from using it should also be put into consideration.
  + It is possible to dodge the bone cage attack by standing just inside the range where the Fuelweaver can begin the cast animation, then quickly stepping out of the ensnare range before it completes. This can be made much easier with speed boosts.
  + Holding the [Shadow Thurible](/wiki/Shadow_Thurible "Shadow Thurible") in hand or having it on the ground would completely prevent the bone cage attack from ensnaring any players within 2 tiles. It’s recommended to use this after your first Fuelweaver fight.
* If allowed to reach Ancient Fuelweaver, Woven Shadows can completely reset any progress the players have made in mere seconds due to the extreme amount of HP they can provide the Fuelweaver.
  + As they only have 1 HP, they can be easily killed with a [Walking Cane](/wiki/Walking_Cane "Walking Cane")/[The Lazy Explorer](/wiki/The_Lazy_Explorer "The Lazy Explorer"), saving the durability of other weapons.
  + Using a [Weather Pain](/wiki/Weather_Pain "Weather Pain") on Fuelweaver does not do much damage to him by itself, but will easily shred any and all nearby Woven Shadows. The ranged capabilities of the Weather Pain make it able to save dire situations where there are too many Woven Shadows near Fuelweaver that can be killed with normal attacks or when players are trapped in bone cages and cannot approach.
    - Due to its very limited amount of charges, bringing more than one Weather Pain (2-4) is suggested, as well as reserving them for aforementioned dire situations.
  + [Abigail](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail") is also incredibly efficient at dealing with Woven Shadows.
* As Unseen Hands can only be attacked when sufficiently insane, this can be problematic when combined with the usual [Shadow Creature](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") attacks and the Fuelweaver's Mind Control ability when at low sanity.
  + A [Nightmare Amulet](/wiki/Nightmare_Amulet "Nightmare Amulet") or two is recommended for this reason. Players still need to be mindful of taking it off before any undesired effects take place as well as to conserve durability, as it may be easy to forget to do so in the midst of the fight.
* Fuelweaver's -400 per min insanity aura only takes effect when a player stands very close to it, though it's still possible to hit him from a slightly further distance. This distance incurs a much lower sanity penalty (about -60 per min), making it much easier to fight it without as many sanity items.
  + Conversely, when wearing a [Bee Queen Crown](/wiki/Bee_Queen_Crown "Bee Queen Crown"), the player has to stand very close to the Fuelweaver to gain full sanity benefit.
* As always, mountains of sanity and healing items is recommended. Examples include [Pierogis](/wiki/Pierogi "Pierogi"), [Healing Salves](/wiki/Healing_Salve "Healing Salve"), [Bee Queen Crowns](/wiki/Bee_Queen_Crown "Bee Queen Crown"), [Green](/wiki/Green_Cap "Green Cap")/[Blue Caps](/wiki/Blue_Cap "Blue Cap") (both raw and cooked), [Banana Shake](/wiki/Banana_Shake "Banana Shake"), and more.
* [Bundling Wrap](/wiki/Bundling_Wrap "Bundling Wrap") can be used to stockpile perishables and bulk items for the fight without needing to worry as much about spoilage or inventory space.

After defeating the Fuelweaver, the player gets access to a few new abilities:

* The [Bone Helm](/wiki/Bone_Helm "Bone Helm") can be used to farm [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures") as well as stay insane for prolonged periods of time without fear of attack.
* The forest Reanimated Skeleton can be used for breaking [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree") or [Marble Trees](/wiki/Marble_Tree "Marble Tree") using the Shadow Thurible to lead it.
* The [Shadow Thurible](/wiki/Shadow_Thurible "Shadow Thurible") can also be used in future Fuelweaver fights to prevent him from using the bone cage attack at all, by dropping it on the floor and keeping it fueled with [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel").

## Placeholder Trivia[]

### "**Caves**"[]

* The Reanimated Skeleton is the first boss that actually "talks" in red text, like [Lucy the Axe](/wiki/Lucy_the_Axe "Lucy the Axe"), but it just makes sounds.
* It can also scare [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") and [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman").

### "**Forest**"[]

* The distance the Reanimated Skeleton has from the Ruins makes it the most unintelligent and passive out of the three reanimated skeletons.
  + According to *Rhymes with Play* #128, it has the weakest mind of the three.
* There seems to be moss growing on the skeleton, yet no moss is seen on its original odd skeleton.
* The Ferns, Light Bulbs, and Lesser Glow Berries that pop out of the ground stay around for 3 seconds, before shriveling up and returning down into the ground.

### **Ancient Fuelweaver**[]
