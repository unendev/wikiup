There are several [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") that exist primarily as visual indicators of a character's low sanity, generally most noticeable at night. Most disappear when the player approaches. One, the Shadow Watcher has a stronger version that overwhelms the character momentarily when [Ancient Fuelweaver](/wiki/Ancient_Fuelweaver "Ancient Fuelweaver") casts its mind-control attack.

The **Shadow Watcher** is a long, thin Shadow Creature that appears around light sources at night (including charged [Lightning Rods](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod")) when the player's Sanity drops below 65%. It cannot attack or be attacked, and will disappear when a player stands on its eyes or when dawn breaks.

### Don't Starve Together Don't Starve Together[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, the [Ancient Fuelweaver](/wiki/Ancient_Fuelweaver "Ancient Fuelweaver")'s Mind Control attack consists of several Shadow Watchers crowding onto the insane player's screen and preventing them from moving.

## Eyes[]

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/5/57/Eyes.png/revision/latest?cb=20130228122413

**Eyes** appear in total darkness when the player's Sanity is below 80%. They do not affect the player in any way, and will disappear when approached. As the player loses Sanity, more eyes will spawn, appearing more intense with lower Sanity. Trees and other obstacles can block eyes, commonly forming a one-eyed Shadow Creature.

### Don't Starve Don't Starve[]

In *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")*, in *Epilogue: Checkmate* of [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"), Eyes will be visible in the darkness regardless of the player's Sanity.

**Mr. Skitts** is a small, serpent-like Shadow Creature that can appear at any time while the player's Sanity is below 82.5%. He cannot attack or be attacked. When approached, he will turn and slither away, disappearing from the screen. His only purpose is to remind players of their Sanity level and provide a scare.

Mr. Skitts will sometimes flicker on the screen for a fraction of a second, then disappear. He can also be seen flying into [Obelisks](/wiki/Obelisk "Obelisk") as they are raised and flying back out of them when they are lowered.

He can also be seen coming out of chests in trapped set pieces and ornate chests when the player opens them, springing the trap.

## Trivia[]

* In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, if one follows a Shadow Watcher's body away from a fire while wearing [Moggles](/wiki/Moggles "Moggles") on a full moon, it's possible to see it despawn abruptly.
* A photo of a person standing next a Shadow Watcher can be seen hanging on the wall of [George T. Witherstone's](/wiki/Minor_Characters#George_T._Witherstone "Minor Characters") apartment, as seen in the animated short *[C'est La Vie](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#C'est_La_Vie "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*.
