**“**Now I can show everyone what I found!**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

**Cartography** is a [filter](/wiki/Crafting#Crafting_Filter "Crafting") in the crafting menu for *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. It allows the players to craft objects using the [Cartographer's Desk](/wiki/Cartographer%27s_Desk "Cartographer's Desk"). Similar to the [Ancient Tab](/wiki/Ancient_Tab "Ancient Tab") and the [Ancient Pseudoscience Station](/wiki/Ancient_Pseudoscience_Station "Ancient Pseudoscience Station"), items under this tab cannot be prototyped and then made on the go in the future; in order to craft an item under this tab, the player must always be near a Cartographer's Desk, no matter how many times the item has been crafted.

## Craftable Items[]

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Cartography Tab was introduced in *[A New Reign](/wiki/A_New_Reign "A New Reign")* update.
* Before [Crafting Filters](/wiki/Crafting#Crafting_Filter "Crafting") were introduced the Player was not able to access the Cartography Tab while [creative mode](/wiki/Console "Console") was turned on because the Cartography Tab shared the same space with the Ancient Tab.
* [Cartography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography "wikipedia:Cartography") is the science and practice of making maps.
