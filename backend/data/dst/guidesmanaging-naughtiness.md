## What is Naughtiness?[]

In Don't Starve (including all DLCs) and Don't Starve Together, there is a hidden but ever-present stat, *Naughtiness*, which is not visible in the statistics area. Getting a high enough naughtiness level will allow [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") to spawn, which can be base-ruining to newer players.

## How Do I Get Naughtiness?[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Naughtiness](/wiki/Naughtiness "Naughtiness")*

A certain amount of naughtiness points is assigned to the player upon killing certain ‘Innocent Creatures', and upon obtaining a certain amount of them (a randomly generated number ranging from 31-50), one or more Krampii will spawn in an attempt to “punish” the troublemaker. These are the best creatures for gaining Naughtiness:

## Baby Beefalo[]

[Baby Beefalo](/wiki/Baby_Beefalo "Baby Beefalo") are spawned during Mating Season (Either Winter or Spring), and give a Naughtiness of 6. They only come around once a game-year, so it's best not to only use this as the primary source for Krampus Farms.

Krampus

## Smallbirds[]

[Smallbirds](/wiki/Smallbirds "Smallbirds") are a relatively cheap source of Naughtiness (One trip to a Tallfort can give about 20 Eggs), but hatching them all is very tedious. Once they are all hatched though, since it's so easy to get large numbers of them, it is very easy to spawn many Krampii in one go.

Krampus

## Glommer[]

[Glommer](/wiki/Glommer "Glommer"), well-known for its whopping 50 Naughtiness point value, will spawn a Krampus every time one is killed by the player. However, due to the fact that it will only respawn during each full moon (which occurs once every 18 days), Glommer killing isn't a reliable source of Krampii due to having to wait nearly an entire season between spawning attempts. Ideally, one should try to kill Glommer on the day immediately preceding the full moon night to maximize the Sanity gained from Glommer’s +6.25/min sanity aura.

## Birds[]

[Birds](/wiki/Birds "Birds") can be caught and killed fairly quickly and can therefore spawn many Krampii with the right setup. If you can, create several Bird Traps (10 is a good start) and bait them with seeds in each one. Check back on the traps after several days and they will likely be full with lots of birds. If one manages to obtain a total of 16-25 birds at once (i.e before they all starve to death), one can easily spawn a Krampus just by murdering all the birds in a short enough period of time. As a bonus, you’ll also end up with lots of morsels and feathers from killing the birds! (If you want to, you can instead cook your birds over a fire pit instead of simply murdering them if you *really* don’t want feathers.) [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom") players can use [Birds of the World](/wiki/Birds_of_the_World "Birds of the World") to quickly summon high numbers of birds and [Sleepytime Stories](/wiki/Books#Sleepytime_Stories "Books") to put said birds to sleep which can lead to even

Krampus

## Shipwrecked[]

## Pirate Parrot[]

In this respect, the [Pirate Parrot](/wiki/Parrot_Pirate "Parrot Pirate") is an amalgamation of a bird and a smallbird. It can be caught the same way any other bird can be caught, but gives 6 naughtiness.

## Doydoy[]

[Doydoys](/wiki/Doydoys "Doydoys") spawn on seperate islands, and must be relocated to each other to begin population. The 50 Naughtiness bonus may be tempting, but remember that one must bring them to each other for any chance of getting the benefits of Doydoys long-term. However, it should be noted that once populated, one may take one to two Doydoys with them into their RoG/Vanilla world, and spawn Krampus without suffering the consequences.

## Seal[]

The [Seal](/wiki/Sealnado "Sealnado") is the loot-drop from the [Sealnado](/wiki/Sealnado "Sealnado"). They give 50 Naughtiness, similarly to Glommer. The player should kill the Seal immediately, resulting in a Krampus.

## Preventing Krampus[]

Since Krampus is spawned directly from naughtiness, the player should, at all times, not kill the following:

Glommer**,**Seal**,**Doydoy (If 1-2 in world)

If one want's a [Glommer's Wings](/wiki/Glommer%27s_Wings "Glommer's Wings"), for an [Old Bell](/wiki/Old_Bell "Old Bell"), one has to make a hostile creature, such as a [Hound](/wiki/Hound "Hound") or [Boss](/wiki/Boss_Monsters "Boss Monsters"), kill Glommer.

It should be noted that when Naughtiness is reaching the limit, one will hear a snorting sound in the background. When hearing this, do not kill any Innocent animals for about four days. By that time, the Naughtiness bar will be empty.

## Krampus Farms[]

To obtain a [Krampus Sack](/wiki/Krampus_Sack "Krampus Sack"), the best backpack in the game, it takes lots of luck, or lots of Krampii. It's a 1% drop from a Krampus, and thus is almost impossible to get purely by killing one. So that's why Krampus farms were made!

A Krampus farm should be created like this:

A walled off area containing a useless item (such as one rot, one charcoal, etc.), and make sure no items are scattered on your screen. Now, kill the favored animal to get your naughtiness. Krampus will spawn, and is too focused on getting the useless item to see you. If done constantly, if a hundred Krampii are spawned, then you will probably get the drop from one of those Krampii, along with tons of [charcoal](/wiki/Charcoal "Charcoal") and [monster meat](/wiki/Monster_meat "Monster meat").

The Krampii should be either kited or killed with 2 blow darts, if they have been mass-produced.
