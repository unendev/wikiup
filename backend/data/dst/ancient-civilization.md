**“**I’d never wanna meet one in person.**”**

–[Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona")

The **Ancient Civilization** were a race of magically and technologically adept beings who destroyed themselves by overuse of [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") (causing the periods of [magical flux](/wiki/Nightmare_Cycle "Nightmare Cycle") and possibly unleashing [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures"), which helped in bringing their downfall). The [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") and [Ancient Archive](/wiki/Ancient_Archive "Ancient Archive") are the remnants of their civilization.

While little is known about them, examination quotes for [Ancient Murals](/wiki/Ancient_Mural "Ancient Mural"), [Ancient Lunarune Stones](/wiki/Ancient_Lunarune_Stone "Ancient Lunarune Stone"), and images from the [Metheus Puzzles](/wiki/Metheus_Puzzles "Metheus Puzzles") offer hints on their history.

When examining the [Ancient Fuelweaver](/wiki/Ancient_Fuelweaver "Ancient Fuelweaver") and the [Ancient Murals](/wiki/Ancient_Mural "Ancient Mural"), a number of characters refer to the members of the Ancient Civilization as "bug people".[[1]](#cite_note-1)[[2]](#cite_note-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3) These quotes also reveal how the bug people were at one point weak and starving, living in fear.[[4]](#cite_note-4) The examination quotes from the [Ancient Lunarune Stones](/wiki/Ancient_Lunarune_Stone "Ancient Lunarune Stone") explain that they were at some point obsessed with the Moon, whom they referred to as a being called [Alter](/wiki/Alter "Alter").[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[6]](#cite_note-6) At some point these people discovered [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel"), which overtook their civilization.[[7]](#cite_note-7) These bug people then shed their outside exoskeletons and were reborn as creatures with a new appearance.[[8]](#cite_note-8) It is at this point that they build a beautiful and prosperous civilization by harnessing the Nightmare Fuel to perform Magic.[[9]](#cite_note-9)

The [Ancient Herald](/wiki/Ancient_Herald "Ancient Herald") that appears during the [Aporkalypse](/wiki/Aporkalypse "Aporkalypse") seems to be a member of this race, having a similar appearance to them.[[10]](#cite_note-10)

Their appearance strongly resembles that of a Terrorbeak: overall body structure and spinal spikes visible on the statues located in the Atrium as well as obelisk carvings. The ancients' forked tails resemble the small legs of a Terrorbeak as well.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The Ancients seem to have used electrical power in some form, as their Relics can drop [Frazzled Wires](/wiki/Frazzled_Wires "Frazzled Wires") when destroyed.
* While little can be confirmed about their appearance, the appearance of the Mage Statue reveals that the ancients may have been arthropodic in structure, with a slightly knobby shell on their backs resembling that of a pill bug. It may be important to note that in the Nightmare Cycle, spikes can be seen extending from both the Head and Mage Statues, showing that they may have been able to extend spikes from their bodies, possibly when angered or in self-defense.
