Wilson with 6 Improved Farms

 

**“**Daucus carota. Edible, and delicious.**”**

–Wickerbottom, when examining a [Carrot](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot").

**Farming** is the process of growing [Food](/wiki/Food "Food") or other [renewable resources](/wiki/Renewable_resources "Renewable resources") to aid in survival. In general, it requires a permanent base camp where the crops can be planted and grown. There are several types of farming including Farms, transplanted items such as [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush"), and Ranching.

## Farms Don't Starve[]

:   *For the farming mechanics in* [Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, see [Farm Plant](/wiki/Farm_Plant "Farm Plant").*

Farms are made by creating [Basic](/wiki/Basic_Farm "Basic Farm") or [Improved Farms](/wiki/Improved_Farm "Improved Farm") which are fertile patches of ground where [Vegetables](/wiki/Vegetable "Vegetable") can be grown. Once built, [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") can be planted in them which will grow into random vegetables, or [Crop Seeds](/wiki/Crop_Seeds "Crop Seeds") for specific crops. Some Vegetables grown from regular Seeds appear more frequently than others (see table, below).

Farms can be used to grow 20 (basic) or 30 (improved) vegetables before they lose fertility and require additional fertilizing. Crops will only grow if they have light and when the [temperature](/wiki/Winterometer "Winterometer") is above 5 degrees; growth stops any other time. When temperature is above 28 degrees crops grow 100% faster; when it's [Raining](/wiki/Rain "Rain") crops grow up to 300% (depending on *precipitation rate*, which will vary over the course of the rain) faster. This means that when it is hot and raining heavily, crops grow up to 400% faster.

It is possible to use any kind of light to allow crop growth: [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire"), [Lantern](/wiki/Lantern "Lantern"), [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch"), [Fireflies](/wiki/Fireflies "Fireflies") or even [Pig House](/wiki/Pig_House "Pig House").

**There are 2 types of Farms:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Speedy Farm Plot | Turbo Farm Plot |
| Basic Farm | Improved Farm |
| 8 [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), 4 [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure"), 4 [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log") Growth Time: **4** days of light **20** uses before re-fertilizing | 10 [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), 6 [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure"), 4 [Stone](/wiki/Stone "Stone") Growth Time: **2** days of light **30** uses before re-fertilizing |

Specific vegetables can be grown in Farms by using Crop Seeds. These seeds are produced by feeding a [Bird](/wiki/Bird "Bird") imprisoned in a [Birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage") any vegetable or fruit; except for [Mandrakes](/wiki/Mandrake "Mandrake") or [Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries"). The Bird will drop 1 or 2 Crop Seeds of the selected type, plus an occasional regular Seed (total of 3 possible seeds). Once planted, Crop Seeds will grow into their corresponding crop.

The following crops can be grown in Farms:

| Item | Name | Chance | Chance Reign of Giants | Chance Shipwrecked | Chance Hamlet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Carrot | **[Carrot](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot")** | **31.6%** | **28.6%** | **22.2%** | **13.3%** |
| Corn | **[Corn](/wiki/Corn "Corn")** | **31.6%** | **28.6%** | **22.2%** | **13.3%** |

Improved Farms; the depleted one is on the right.

 

Items such as [Guano](/wiki/Guano "Guano"), [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure"), [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot"), and [Rotten Eggs](/wiki/Rotten_Egg "Rotten Egg") can be used as fertilizers. When placed on the sprout in a Farm, fertilizers will advance its growth. The amount of fertilizer needed to fully grow a newly planted crop depends on the type of Farm and the type of fertilizer.

[Guano](/wiki/Guano "Guano") substitutes 1.5 days, [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure") and each [Bucket-o-poop](/wiki/Bucket-o-poop "Bucket-o-poop") use substitutes 1 day, and [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot")/[Rotten Egg](/wiki/Rotten_Egg "Rotten Egg") substitutes 0.25 days. Thus, [Basic Farms](/wiki/Basic_Farm "Basic Farm") need 3 Guano, 4 Manure or 16 Rot/Rotten Eggs, and [Improved Farms](/wiki/Improved_Farm "Improved Farm") need only 2 Guano, 2 Manure or 8 Rot/Rotten Eggs to fully grow a newly planted crop. Fertilizers do not advance crop growth when it's below 0 [degrees](/wiki/Winterometer "Winterometer") in [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), and using a fire to warm the area will not change this.

Fertilizers are also needed when a Farm loses fertility, which happens after 20 or 30 uses depending on the type of Farm. When a Farm is depleted, it will turn a lighter shade of brown and cannot be used for growing anything until fertilizer is added. Guano will rejuvenate a Farm for 12 additional uses, Manure for 10 and Rot/Rotten Eggs will only provide 2.

Fertilizers are also needed for transplanted plants. [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush") and [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft") that are dug up with a shovel and replanted must be fertilized before they will start to grow again. After a Berry Bush has been harvested 3-5 times or a Grass Tuft 20 times, they will require additional fertilizer. Naturally grown Bushes, Grass, and Saplings never need to be fertilized.

### Reign of Giants icon Reign of Giants[]

In *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")*, [Glommer's Goop](/wiki/Glommer%27s_Goop "Glommer's Goop") substitutes 1 day, so 4 are needed for a Basic Farm and 2 are needed for an Improved Farm.

Additionally, Glommer's Goop rejuvenates a Farm for 8 additional uses when used on an empty farm bed.

The [Bucket-o-poop](/wiki/Bucket-o-poop "Bucket-o-poop") acts like regular Manure, substituting 1 day and rejuvenating 10 additional uses on a farm.

Crops no longer get a 100% bonus growth rate from heat and can wither in extreme heat. Spring gives a 25% bonus on a crops' growth rate when it is not raining.

## Transplanting[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/15/Collectable plants %28Berry Bush%2C Grass%2C Sapling%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20141214141835 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/15/Collectable plants %28Berry Bush%2C Grass%2C Sapling%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20141214141835 



 

[Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush"), [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft"), [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling"), and [Spiky Bushes](/wiki/Spiky_Bush "Spiky Bush") can all be dug up with a [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel") and replanted anywhere. Typically, this is done to move them closer to a base camp for easy harvesting. Tufts and Bushes will need to be fertilized after being planted. Replanted Saplings and Spiky Bushes do not need to be fertilized. During winter, with the exception of Spiky Bushes, these plants will grow so slowly, they will seem not to regrow at all.

During [Summer](/wiki/Summer#Reign_of_Giants "Summer") in the [*Reign of Giants*](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")DLC, Saplings, Berry Bushes and Grass Tufts will dry out due to the heat. They will come back to a normal state when the season changes.

Using [Pine Cones](/wiki/Pine_Cone "Pine Cone"), [Evergreens](/wiki/Evergreens "Evergreens") can be grown anywhere and will be active in all seasons. They can provide a constant and renewable source of [Logs](/wiki/Logs "Logs"), but caution should be taken with any spawning [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguards "Treeguards").

Planting these items close together will make them easy to quickly gather, but it leaves them vulnerable to [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") strikes, which can set the entire patch ablaze. This can be mitigated by planting in groups with gaps or building a [Lightning Rod](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod"). Having them close together also leaves them vulnerable to a mass Fire, whether from Willow's Insanity, a Red Hound dying, Summer heat, or other reason.

## Lureplant Farm[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/9/9c/Lureplants-missing-lures.png/revision/latest?cb=20130823045107 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/9/9c/Lureplants-missing-lures.png/revision/latest?cb=20130823045107 

Example of a Lureplant farm on top of Cobblestones

 

[Lureplants](/wiki/Lureplants "Lureplants") do not spawn their Eyeplants on [Rocky Turf](/wiki/Rocky_Turf "Rocky Turf"), [Cave Rock Turf](/wiki/Cave_Rock_Turf "Cave Rock Turf"), [Cobblestones](/wiki/Cobblestones "Cobblestones"), and [Wooden](/wiki/Wooden_Flooring "Wooden Flooring"), [Carpeted](/wiki/Carpeted_Flooring "Carpeted Flooring") or [Checkerboard Flooring](/wiki/Checkerboard_Flooring "Checkerboard Flooring"). This means that surrounding the Lureplant with these types of turf will make it safe to harvest its [Leafy Meat](/wiki/Leafy_Meat "Leafy Meat").

The Leafy Meat can be eaten, given to [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") to befriend them, or given to a [caged bird](/wiki/Bird_Cage "Bird Cage") for a fresh [Egg](/wiki/Egg "Egg"). Once harvested, the Lureplant takes two days to spawn another Leafy Meat. To harvest the Leafy Meat without hitting the plant, the player must unequip any weapon and then click on the Lureplant.
If the player doesn't farm the Lureplant for a few days, and then go to the plant and try to take the Meat, it will count as if it already spoiled and the player does not get anything.

Since Lureplants are inactive in Winter, Leafy Meat will be unavailable for the season.

## Slime Farm[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a1/Slime farm.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131029151056 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a1/Slime farm.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131029151056 

A simple Slime Farm with one single mound.

 

[Slurtle Slime](/wiki/Slurtle_Slime "Slurtle Slime") is a non-spoiling item used to refuel [Lanterns](/wiki/Lantern "Lantern") or [Miner Hats](/wiki/Miner_Hat "Miner Hat") and cause [Earthquakes](/wiki/Earthquakes "Earthquakes") in caves. It's dropped mainly by [Slurtles](/wiki/Slurtles "Slurtles") and [Snurtles](/wiki/Snurtles "Snurtles") when they eat [Stones](/wiki/Stone "Stone"), [Flint](/wiki/Flint "Flint"), [Gold](/wiki/Gold "Gold"), etc.

The slime can be farmed by luring the Snurtles or Slurtles with a container on the ground containing a bunch of mineral items. The critters will stick around to eat the rocks (by whacking the rocks out of the chest) and produce slime. Building [Walls](/wiki/Wall "Wall") can keep them in one place.

## Ranching[]

Ranching is the farming of animals such as [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterfly "Butterfly"), [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig"), [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit"), and [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo"). Generally, ranching can only be done with animals that can respawn. Each type of animal requires its own way of ranching.

### Butterfly Farms[]

Butterfly farms can be produced by catching butterflies in a [Bug Net](/wiki/Bug_Net "Bug Net"). Once captured, they can be planted as [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") anywhere. Flowers require no maintenance and can spawn additional Butterflies as soon as they are planted. When the Butterfly population is high enough, they can be killed for their [Wings](/wiki/Butterfly_Wings "Butterfly Wings") or [Butter](/wiki/Butter "Butter"). Butterflies will spawn in all seasons except for Winter. As with most farms, building a [Lightning Rod](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod") should be the only necessary defense.

One can plant caught Butterflies near Beefalo herds. The Beefalo will attack any Butterflies that spawn from Flowers during their mating season. Any items that the Butterflies drop can be safely collected while wearing a [Beefalo Hat](/wiki/Beefalo_Hat "Beefalo Hat").

Another way to farm butterflies, exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, is to plant a Flower near [Magma](/wiki/Magma "Magma"). The spawning butterflies will die due to the fire damage. However this method is risky if the [Dragonfly](/wiki/Dragonfly "Dragonfly") is nearby.

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* the player can also use a [Bramble Husk](/wiki/Bramble_Husk "Bramble Husk") and [Bramble Traps](/wiki/Bramble_Trap "Bramble Trap") to harvest butterflies.

In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC, planting [flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") around an [Elephant Cactus](/wiki/Elephant_Cactus "Elephant Cactus") will make for an efficient and resource-friendly butterfly farm. However, players will need to wear a [Cactus Armor](/wiki/Cactus_Armor "Cactus Armor") to be able to harvest the drops safely.

### Moleworm Farms[]

[Moleworms](/wiki/Moleworm "Moleworm") can be farmed by releasing several placed Moleworms in an enclosed area. Moleworms will be moved out of their [Burrows](/wiki/Burrow "Burrow") when hit with a [Hammer](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer") or when their Burrows are dug out with the [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel"). Once placed in an enclosed area, the Moleworms will create new Burrows from which they'll respawn after being killed.

### Catcoons[]

[Catcoon](/wiki/Catcoon "Catcoon") may be farmed for its gifts. This can be done by creating an enclosed wall around a Catcoon and flowers. Catcoon will use the butterflies from the flowers to spit out gifts.

In order to have more than one Catcoon in an enclosed wall, a new space must be created, as the wild Catcoon and the befriended Catcoon are aggressive towards each other. After some time, befriended Catcoon will become wild Catcoon, and it will be safe to conjoin the two. Note, player should only befriend one Catcoon at a time, since if more than one befriended Catcoons are to reach the player, the Catcoon that first spits out the gift will start attacking the other Catcoon.

### Bees and Honey[]

[Bees](/wiki/Bees "Bees") and [Honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey") can be farmed by building [Bee Boxes](/wiki/Bee_Box "Bee Box") near a flower field.

A Bee Box will spawn a Bee every 2 minutes, up to a maximum of 4. If any of these Bees are caught or killed, another one will spawn after the 2-minute cooldown. The Bees can be caught with a Bug Net and then be either murdered for [Stingers](/wiki/Stinger "Stinger") and Honey or used to make [Bee Mines](/wiki/Bee_Mines "Bee Mines"). If a Bee is caught, all Bees still inside its box will become [Killer Bees](/wiki/Killer_Bees "Killer Bees") and attack the player, and homeless Bees outside will often join them.

When Bees successfully visit 6 Flowers, they will return to their box and increase the amount of Honey contained in it by 1, up to a maximum of 6. Honey can then be harvested at the Bee Box, but the Bees inside the box will come out as hostile regular Bees. A [Beekeeper Hat](/wiki/Beekeeper_Hat "Beekeeper Hat") is advised to tank the damage, or the player can just run away until the Bees lose interest. Harvesting Honey while all 4 Bees are outside the box will result in no bees attacking. If the player wanders too far away from the Bee Boxes, the game will hibernate the boxes and decrease the speed at which Honey is produced by several times.

Bee Boxes are dormant in [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"): Bees don't leave their homes, and the Honey stays on the boxes until the player gathers it. Gathering honey this way during winter is easier, since the bees do not come out to attack when the player collects their honey. The game's hibernation system actually assists the player in winter, as Bee Boxes far enough from the player will still produce honey at hibernation rates regardless of the bees' lack of activity.

### Pigs[]

[Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") spawn from [Pig Houses](/wiki/Pig_House "Pig House"). Each house will spawn one Pig at a time. If the Pig dies, another will respawn after 4 days. Pigs sometimes drop [Pig Skin](/wiki/Pig_Skin "Pig Skin") when killed, which is required to make additional Pig Houses. Pigs can be convinced to fight and chop trees for the player by giving them [meats](/wiki/Meats "Meats"), and they produce [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure") when fed [vegetables](/wiki/Vegetables "Vegetables").

Pigs left outside during a full moon will transform into [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig"), and become hostile towards everything. Feeding a Pig 4 pieces of [Monster Foods](/wiki/Monster_Food "Monster Food") (Monster Meat Cooked Monster Meat Monster Jerky Monster Lasagna) will automatically transform it into a Werepig. They drop 2 [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") and 1 Pig Skin when killed. Werepigs will quickly eat any food lying on the ground. Normal Pigs in the area will not target the player attacking a Werepig, making them a good option for farming regular meat.

### Bunnymen[]

[Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnymen "Bunnymen") are the [Cave](/wiki/Caves "Caves") counterparts of [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs"). They spawn from [Rabbit Hutches](/wiki/Rabbit_Hutches "Rabbit Hutches") and function similar to Pigs, but several traits make them more difficult to recruit and use as allies. They're suited for nocturnal protection at which Pigs fail and can be used to farm [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders"). Their [Bunny Puffs](/wiki/Bunny_Puffs "Bunny Puffs") can be used to make a [Fur Roll](/wiki/Bed_Roll#Fur_Roll "Bed Roll") or more Rabbit Hutches.

### Beefalo[]

Beefalo can be brought to a desired location with the use of a [Beefalo Horn](/wiki/Beefalo_Horn "Beefalo Horn") and a pen made of Walls. Wearing a [Beefalo Hat](/wiki/Beefalo_Hat "Beefalo Hat") will protect the player from aggressive Beefalo during mating season.

### Spiders[]

[Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider") spawn from [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Dens "Spider Dens"), objects that may be spawned by planting [Spider Eggs](/wiki/Spider_Eggs "Spider Eggs"). Spider Eggs can be obtained by killing a [Spider Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen") or destroying a tier 3 den. The higher the tier of the den, the more Spiders and [Spider Warriors](/wiki/Spider_Warrior "Spider Warrior") spawn from it. Spiders, when killed, will drop either [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat"), [Silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk") or [Spider Glands](/wiki/Spider_Glands "Spider Glands").

A simple method to farm spider drops is by placing [Traps](/wiki/Traps "Traps") near the den. Step on the [Sticky Webbing](/wiki/Spider_Den#Sticky_Webbing "Spider Den") to get the spiders to come out, then lead them to the Traps. Repeat until the den is empty. It is a simple but time-consuming method.

The player may build [Pig Houses](/wiki/Pig_Houses "Pig Houses") or [Rabbit Hutches](/wiki/Rabbit_Hutch "Rabbit Hutch") around the den to kill stray Spiders, but surviving Pigs will eat Monster Meat on sight (possibly turning into Werepigs) and Bunnymen will attack a player gathering Monster Meat.

### Rabbits[]

(Not to be confused with [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman")) A good spot to farm [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit") would be an area with at least three [Rabbit Holes](/wiki/Rabbit_Hole "Rabbit Hole") near each other. Place Traps directly on top of the Rabbit Hole, so when the Rabbit comes out, it will instantly be trapped. Rarely, the Rabbit may trigger the Trap without being caught. The best time to check traps is before dusk. Rabbits will hibernate during [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"), but caved-in Rabbit Holes can be dug up with a [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel"). This will disrupt hibernating Rabbits, making it possible to trap them. However this approach will destroy the Rabbit Hole, preventing more Rabbits to spawn from it.

Captured rabbits may also be relocated to a penned-in area for later slaughter. Simply drop the rabbit from your inventory in the pen while it is still alive. Since the rabbit holes will spawn new rabbits periodically (even if the original is still alive somewhere), this is a good way to stockpile food for Winter.

### https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/46/Shipwrecked icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20151205104708 Doydoys[]

When [Doydoys](/wiki/Doydoys "Doydoys") are rescued from extinction, they can be positioned in almost any area of the map, and require no maintenance, given that there are no aggressive mobs present near them. Doydoy farms can be essential in Winter when food is scarce as killing one Doydoy offers 2 [drumsticks](/wiki/Drumsticks "Drumsticks"), 1 [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") and Doydoy feathers that can be used to craft the [Feather Lite Sail](/wiki/Feather_Lite_Sail "Feather Lite Sail"). They also multiply very quickly and can sustain a player for long periods of time. Player has to take caution in leaving at least two Doydoys alive at any given time as Doysdoys can only respawn with two Adult Doydoys in the immediate vicinity in which they have been placed.
