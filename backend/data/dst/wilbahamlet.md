Wilba starts with the [Silver Necklace](/wiki/Silver_Necklace "Silver Necklace"), which will prevent Wilba from turning into a Werepig when wearing, but will drain Sanity instead. However, after Wilba is already in Werepig form, she is unable to put on the necklace, so it cannot reverse the form once it has begun.

As Wilba is a pig princess, pigs will not panic or attack her for stealing, such as picking [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass") or [Flowers](/wiki/Flowers "Flowers") from farms. In addition, pigs will occasionally gift her basic resources ([Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs"), [Flint](/wiki/Flint "Flint"), [Rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks"), Grass, Logs and [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds")). She can do whatever she pleases in Pig Towns. This includes hammering any buildings or structures. However, [Royal Guards](/wiki/Royal_Guard "Royal Guard") will still retaliate if she attacks them or a [Pig Trader](/wiki/Pig_Traders "Pig Traders") near them. [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") in the base game will also give Wilba basic resources. In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* DLC, [Wildbores](/wiki/Wildbore "Wildbore") will never attack Wilba if she is near them multiple times. Hammering [their house](/wiki/Wildbore_House "Wildbore House") makes them attempt to attack her, however.

Like [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber"), she can eat monster meats ([Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat"), [Bean Bugs](/wiki/Bean_Bugs "Bean Bugs") and [Gummy Slugs](/wiki/Gummy_Slug "Gummy Slug"), including cooked and dried variations) without receiving negative effects on health and sanity.

**“**TIS THE CURSE O' THE HAIRY PIG!**”**

–[Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba")

The **Werewilba** is the cursed form of [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba"). In this [Werepig](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig") form, the special music *"Werepig of London"* will begin to play.

Wilba is able to turn into a Werepig during a [Full Moon](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle"), [Aporkalypse](/wiki/Aporkalypse "Aporkalypse"), or after eating two [Monster Food](/wiki/Monster_Food "Monster Food") items within half a day. Transforming into a Werepig restores health to full.

Wilba reverts back to her normal pig form after the Full Moon or Aporkalypse ends, also restoring health to full. If the transformation was induced by eating monster food, she will turn back after 1 Day. Each monster food eaten will extend the duration of the transformation by half a Day. Note that Gummy Slugs and Bean Bugs count as monster food and will turn Wilba into a Werepig. Eating [Jellyfish](/wiki/Jellyfish "Jellyfish") (raw or cooked) won't turn Wilba into a Werepig. Upon returning to her normal form, Wilba will drop 2 [Beard Hairs](/wiki/Beard_Hair "Beard Hair").

The Werewilba is able to [chop](/wiki/Axe "Axe"), [dig](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel"), [mine](/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe"), [hammer](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer") and [hack](/wiki/Machete "Machete") objects, and fight Mobs, but otherwise can't interact with objects in any other way. She has limited night vision and as such is immune to the [Night Monster](/wiki/Night_Monster "Night Monster"). She can also heal herself by 0.5 Health per second as long as she is not starving.

Her attack strength is equivalent to the damage of a [Thulecite Club](/wiki/Thulecite_Club "Thulecite Club") or fresh [Ham Bat](/wiki/Ham_Bat "Ham Bat") (59.5).

In contrast to [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie")'s [Werebeaver](/wiki/Werebeaver "Werebeaver") form:

* She is still able to pick up, use, and craft items, while the Werebeaver cannot.
* Werewilba is not immune to [Poison](/wiki/Poison "Poison"), [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") and [Hay Fever](/wiki/Hay_Fever "Hay Fever").
* Werewilba has no damage reduction.
* The [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") is still available to her.

## Disadvantage[]

Wilba is afraid of the dark, and will lose Sanity at 1.5 times the normal rate in darkness. Coupled with her low maximum Sanity of 100, this makes it possible to quickly switch between sane and insane states.

Upon becoming a Werepig, her hand, body and head slots all become furs, which make her unable to equip items. She cannot ride [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") or [Boats](/wiki/Boats "Boats"), either. As a Werepig, her Hunger drains 5 times as fast as in her normal form, draining from full to 0 in less than one Day. Werewilba is considered a [Monster](/wiki/Monster "Monster"), causing Pigs and other friendly mobs to attack her on sight. Additionally, she cannot use structures like [Campfires](/wiki/Campfires "Campfires"), [Crock Pots](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot"), [Farms](/wiki/Farm "Farm"), or [Chests](/wiki/Chests "Chests"), hammering them instead. She cannot choose actions when multiple apply, and prioritizes destructive actions. For example, grown [Bamboo](/wiki/Bamboo "Bamboo") can only be dug, not hacked, and [Walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls") can only be hammered after being attacked and damaged to 0 health. Dying as werepig counts as proper player [death](/wiki/Death "Death"), ending the game or consuming a resurrection item. The player always resurrects into Wilba's normal form.

## Prototype Tips[]

* In the early days, the easiest way to restore the sanity lost from darkness is to collect [Flowers](/wiki/Flowers "Flowers") and [Seashells](/wiki/Seashell "Seashell") while exploring.
* Wilba in her werepig form isn't immune to [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain"). She still get [wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") in [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") or [Fog](/wiki/Fog "Fog") and her fur can be wet, causing her to drain sanity over time.
* Although Wilba's werepig form can get poisoned, her healing speed is faster than speed of health loss cause by poison. Poison makes her drain hunger a little slower, but also make her drain sanity over time.
* Wilba's regeneration and hunger multipliers mean that when she is not starving, she is recovering 0.5 health while losing 0.78125 hunger per second. This means consuming a [Radish](/wiki/Radish "Radish") which is 12.5 hunger will result in healing 8 health over time. Careful balancing of starving and regeneration can minimize food usage.
* It takes 256 seconds to go from full Hunger (200 points) to starving while in the Werepig form. A full day of transformation lasts 480 seconds. To get through an entire transformation cycle without starving, Wilba needs to eat 375 Hunger points worth of food (30 radishes). Assuming she starts on a full stomach, this is 175 points (14 radishes).
* However, as transforming back to Wilba restores all health, and starving at 0 Hunger reduces 1 Health per second, Wilba technically only needs to last 281 seconds and can starve for the remaining 199 and return to full health when transforming back. 281 seconds corresponds to 220 points of Hunger. However, this is inadvisable because starving at low health can easily kill Wilba from a surprise attack.
* Wilba's werepig form can be insane, which means she can farm [Nightmare Fuels](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel"). Her high attack, fast speed and the ability to heal herself allows her to easily fight [Crawling Horror](/wiki/Crawling_Horror "Crawling Horror") and [Terrorbeak](/wiki/Terrorbeak "Terrorbeak").
* Werewilba requires less chops to chop down a tree, including [Poison Birchnut Trees](/wiki/Tree/Birchnut "Tree/Birchnut").
* It is advised to prepare as much food as one can before playing as Wilba's werepig form. Wilba's werepig form can neither open [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester"), [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest"), [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box") or any other containers, nor cook food in fire sources or [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot"). Eating some raw food still loses sanity.
* As a Werepig, Wilba can still raise her "naughtiness" rating and cause [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") to arrive.
* Wilba will transform into a Werepig in the [Caves](/wiki/Cave "Cave"), [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins"), [Cave Cleft](/wiki/Cave_Cleft "Cave Cleft"), [Ancient Pig Ruins](/wiki/Ancient_Pig_Ruin "Ancient Pig Ruin") and [Mant Hill](/wiki/Mant_Hill "Mant Hill") during the Full Moon cycle or Aporkalypse. This means that Wilba will likely wake up to complete darkness.
* The [Slurper](/wiki/Slurper "Slurper") can still equip itself as an item in Wilba's Werepig form's fur, draining Hunger about 50 times faster than normal.
* If the player wants to get an [Old Bell](/wiki/Old_Bell "Old Bell") in the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, the best way is to wear the [Silver Necklace](/wiki/Silver_Necklace "Silver Necklace") during full moon nights.

## Mosquito Bugs[]

* The text that follows completing [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") as Wilba uses masculine pronouns
* Attempting to enter a yet to generate Ruins during the Werepig form will crash the game.
  + This can effectively render a world permanently lost, since entering the save file again will make the game attempt to generate the Ruins, and thus crashing indefinitely.
