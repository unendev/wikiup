**“**YES! BURN!**”**

–[Willow](/wiki/Willow "Willow")

**Fire** is a commonly-occurring game mechanic.

Fire is very important for various reasons. Primarily, it is used to provide light at [Night](/wiki/Night "Night"), which prevents [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie_(Night_Monster) "Charlie (Night Monster)") from attacking. Additionally, fire allows food to be [cooked](/wiki/Cooking "Cooking"), increasing its [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") and [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") values. Fire also provides warmth during [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), which counteracts [freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing"). Despite these benefits however, fire can also be dangerous, as being too close to one will drain Health.

Flaming items or objects may have different descriptions than non-burning ones; for example, a burning log versus one that's just sitting there.

## Light[]

There are several sources of fire which provide light. Most of these can be found in the [Light Tab](/wiki/Light_Tab "Light Tab"), represented by the Campfire icon. These sources include [Campfires](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire"), [Fire Pits](/wiki/Fire_Pit "Fire Pit"), [Torches](/wiki/Torch "Torch"), or [Stars](/wiki/Star "Star"). Additionally, anything actually on fire, such as [Plants](/wiki/Plants "Plants") or [Flammable Objects](/wiki/Category:Flammable_Objects "Category:Flammable Objects"), will give off light as long as they are burning.

Light serves several purposes: mainly it is used to see at night, though it is also needed to prevent [Charlie](/wiki/Night_Monster "Night Monster") from attacking. Additionally, light prevents the large [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") loss from being in total darkness (however, it does not prevent the gradual loss caused by Dusk/Night time). If Sanity does drop too low, [Night Hands](/wiki/Night_Hand "Night Hand") will begin to approach the fire and extinguish portions of it; eventually they may put it out completely. These hands can be scared off by stepping on them and running them towards the edge of the fire's light.

## Cooking[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Cooking](/wiki/Cooking "Cooking")*

Fire Pits, Campfires, or Stars can be used to cook foods. [Cooking](/wiki/Cooking "Cooking") has various positive effects. For most foods, the amount of Hunger they restore is increased and a small Health boost is added. Eating raw [Meats](/wiki/Meats "Meats") decreases Sanity, while cooked meats do not. Additionally, [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat"), eaten raw, will reduce Health and Sanity, but these effects are lessened with cooking.

## Warmth[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing")*

In Winter, characters will begin to freeze if they are away from fire for too long (warm clothing helps prevent this). As long as the character is within a certain radius of a fire, they will stay warm. This includes any burning objects like trees. Fires can also warm [Thermal Stones](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone"), which can be carried around to slow down freezing.

## Fire Damage[]

Objects, items, and Mobs that are on fire can cause 8-12 Health damage per second if they are too close to the player. Most mobs will also take fire damage, when on fire, or when they are close to open fires, which can be used as an offensive tactic.

The following are immune to fire damage/being set on fire:

## Flammable Objects[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 See also: [Category: Flammable Objects](/wiki/Category:Flammable_Objects "Category:Flammable Objects")*

Uncontained fires can spread to nearby flammable objects, and can quickly get out of control. If mobs are set on fire, either by open fire sources, or by items like [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff"), the fire will spread even faster and will be harder to control as the mobs on fire will run around, spreading the fire on everything flammable around them. However, the [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff") can extinguish the smoldering phase of either a mob or an object, as well as when the object is burning. When not extinguished on time, huge chain reaction fires can begin, destroying vast amounts of resources depending on location. Campfires (but not Fire Pits) are also considered uncontained fires and will spread to nearby flammable objects if they are too close.

Any flammable item that can be picked up will turn to [Ashes](/wiki/Ashes "Ashes") if set on fire, while burnt trees such as Evergreens and Mushtrees will yield [Charcoal](/wiki/Charcoal "Charcoal"). [Structures](/wiki/Category:Structures "Category:Structures") that have been burnt will return 1/4th of their materials when [hammered](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer").

## Starting Fires[]

Torches and Fire Staffs can be used to purposely set things on fire by clicking the item on the object or clicking the object with the item equipped. It is also possible to light items in the inventory on fire by dragging a Torch over it and pressing RMB (Right Mouse Button). Most mobs can also be set on fire using [Fire Darts](/wiki/Fire_Dart "Fire Dart").

[Red Hounds](/wiki/Red_Hound "Red Hound") will combust upon death, spreading fire on the spot that can destroy nearby objects and damage the player. The Red Hound's flames will disappear after a few seconds and yield Ashes.

[Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") strikes will create fires as well, unless they are absorbed by a [Lightning Rod](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod").

In **[Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain")**, fuel burns faster (depending on *precipitation rate*):

* **Fire Pit** up to 200% faster
* **Campfire** up to 250% faster
* **Torch** up to 150% faster

In all [DLCs](/wiki/DLC "DLC"), [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") causes fuel items to become waterlogged. Waterlogged fuel burns for only 75% of the time of dry fuel. This effect can also apply to a variety of special fuels used on certain equipment, such as [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel"), [Light Bulb](/wiki/Light_Bulb "Light Bulb"), [Glow Berry](/wiki/Glow_Berry "Glow Berry") and [Lesser Glow Berry](/wiki/Lesser_Glow_Berry "Lesser Glow Berry").

More objects are flammable in DLCs and fire can be put out by some fertilizers and [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice").

In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, the [Summer](/wiki/Summer#Reign_of_Giants "Summer") heat can cause things to smolder and ignite. Building an [Ice Flingomatic](/wiki/Ice_Flingomatic "Ice Flingomatic") will put out small fires and prevent smoldering objects from combusting. Players can also put out smoldering objects using their hands at the cost of Health, or through some fertilizers, Ice, [Luxury Fan](/wiki/Luxury_Fan "Luxury Fan") or an [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff"). [Dragonfly](/wiki/Dragonfly "Dragonfly") is the Summer seasonal [Boss](/wiki/Boss "Boss"), who can create fires.

In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC, two new craftable sources of fire were added, [Chimineas](/wiki/Chiminea "Chiminea") and [Obsidian Fire Pits](/wiki/Obsidian_Fire_Pit "Obsidian Fire Pit"). Obsidian Fire Pits burn three times as long as Campfires, or 1.5 times as long as Fire Pits and Chimineas. Additionally, [Krissures](/wiki/Krissure "Krissure") and [Lava Pools](/wiki/Lava_Pool "Lava Pool") also act as fire, providing light and heat, and allowing food to be cooked on them.

[Dragoon Eggs](/wiki/Dragoon_Egg "Dragoon Egg") falling during [Volcanic Eruptions](/wiki/Volcanic_Eruption "Volcanic Eruption") can start fires, as well as the [Dragoons](/wiki/Dragoons "Dragoons") that spawn from intact eggs after the eruption and from [Dragoon Dens](/wiki/Dragoon_Den "Dragoon Den") in the [Volcano](/wiki/Volcano_(biome) "Volcano (biome)"). [Dry Season](/wiki/Dry_Season "Dry Season"), which is the equivalent to Summer in *Reign of Giants*, does not contain combustion. *Shipwrecked* also introduces two new mechanics: [Strong Winds](/wiki/Strong_Winds "Strong Winds"), which can cause fires to quickly dim and extinguish, and [Flooding](/wiki/Flooding "Flooding"), which prevents lighting both fire pits and camp fires. Chimineas protect against both mechanics.

In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")* DLC, two new sources of fire were added, [Crumbling Brazier](/wiki/Crumbling_Brazier "Crumbling Brazier") and [Wall Brazier](/wiki/Wall_Brazier "Wall Brazier"). Both of them behave near-identically to Campfires, as they can be fueled to provide Light and a means of cooking Food and they may also set nearby flammable objects on fire. *Hamlet* also introduces a new mechanics: [Heavy Fog](/wiki/Heavy_Fog "Heavy Fog"), which can cause fires to burn as 60% fast as in Rain.

[Thunderbird](/wiki/Thunderbird "Thunderbird") will emit three (ten during [Aporkalypse](/wiki/Aporkalypse "Aporkalypse")) Lightning bolts which can start fire. *Hamlet* world does not contain combustion. *Hamlet* also introduces Strong Winds. [Royal Guard](/wiki/Royal_Guard "Royal Guard") will put out fire.

Additionally, several fuel items were added:

## https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b0/Don%27t Starve Together icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20150127043033 Don't Starve Together[]

*[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* contains the changes from the *Reign of Giants* DLC but changes the burn time of [turfs](/wiki/Turfs "Turfs") to 15 sec. Additionally, the [Lavae](/wiki/Lavae "Lavae") can start fires, while [Scaled Flooring](/wiki/Scaled_Flooring "Scaled Flooring") slows the spreading of fire.

When [Willow](/wiki/Willow "Willow") fuels a fire, it is 50% more efficient compared to other characters.

Some new tools added in *Don't Starve Together* like the [Watering Can](/wiki/Watering_Can "Watering Can") and the [Fire Pump](/wiki/Fire_Pump "Fire Pump") can be used to put out fire. Rain has a chance to put out an object that is smoldering. During spring, the burn range of all objects is halved. This means fires will not spread as fast and mobs will take less damage from being in the middle of many burning objects.

The following are some example of fuel items added in *Don't Starve Together*:
