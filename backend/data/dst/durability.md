|  | This article is **incomplete** *because of the evil sabotage by [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell/NPC "Maxwell/NPC")...*. Please help to [improve the article](https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Durability?action=edit), or discuss the issue with the community on the [comment section](#WikiaArticleComments). |

**Durability** is a game-concept which limits the amount of usage an item or structure has. It generally applies to items which can be equipped, however there are some other items such as the [Sewing Kit](/wiki/Sewing_Kit "Sewing Kit") or [Pan Flute](/wiki/Pan_Flute "Pan Flute") which also have it. An item with durability can be identified by a percentage number in front of its inventory graphic. For example, an [Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe") will have a 100% over its icon when first created, and this number will change as the Axe is used. Different items use durability in different ways:

## Tools[]

[Tools](/wiki/Tools "Tools") lose durability whenever they are used for their specific actions and in the same way as [weapons](/wiki/Weapons "Weapons") do when attacking something.
The 3 most common Tools ([Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe"), [Pickaxe](/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe"), and [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel")) also have special versions with a much higher durability ([Luxury Axe](/wiki/Luxury_Axe "Luxury Axe"), [Opulent Pickaxe](/wiki/Opulent_Pickaxe "Opulent Pickaxe"), and [Regal Shovel](/wiki/Regal_Shovel "Regal Shovel") respectively).

| Name | # of Uses | Special |

| Luxury Axe | 400 | Chops down trees. |

| Beefalo Horn | 10 | Makes up to 5 [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") follow the player. |

## Light emitters[]

Light emitting items gradually run out of fuel. Some of them can be refueled while others are done for. [Miner Hat](/wiki/Miner_Hat "Miner Hat") and [Fire Pit](/wiki/Fire_Pit "Fire Pit") for instance can be refueled when they run out of juice, while [Torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch") and [Pumpkin Lantern](/wiki/Pumpkin_Lantern "Pumpkin Lantern") are done for in that case.

| Name | Burn time | Special |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Campfire | 4.5 min | Provides light and warmth. |
| Fire Pit | 6 min | Provides efficient light and warmth. |
| Torch | 75 sec | Illuminates a small area and gives a little warmth. |
| Miner Hat | 1 Day | Provides light. |
| Pumpkin Lantern | 10 min in [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer"), 13 min 20 sec in [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter") | Illuminates a small area. |
| Lantern | 1 Day | Provides light. |
| Night Light | 11 min 40 sec | Provides light, drains sanity. |

## Survival items[]

[Survival](/wiki/Survival "Survival") items lose durability when used by the player or when triggered by mobs. Some of them can be used as weapons but will lose durability much faster.

| Name | # of Uses | Special |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bird Trap | 8 | Captures [Birds](/wiki/Birds "Birds"). |
| Trap | 8 | Captures [rabbits](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit") and other small animals. |
| Fur Roll | 3 | Restores [sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") and [health](/wiki/Health "Health") at the expense of [hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"). |
| Tent | 6 | Restores sanity and health at the expense of hunger. |
| Umbrella | 20 (Only when attacking) | Prevents [sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") loss from [rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain"). |
| Bug Net | 10 (4 when attacking) | Catches insects. |
| Fishing Rod | 9 (3 when attacking) | Captures fish and eels in [ponds](/wiki/Pond "Pond"). |
| Basic Farm | 20 | Grows [seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds"). |
| Improved Farm | 30 | Grows seeds faster. |

## Weapons[]

[Weapons](/wiki/Weapons "Weapons") use **Durability** to determine the number of times they can hit something before breaking. A [Spear](/wiki/Spear "Spear") for example losses 0.66% of its durability each time it is used to attack something, allowing it to be used 150 times. Each weapon has a different number of uses.

| Name | # of Uses | Special |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spear | 150 |  |
| Ham Bat | Unlimited | Spoils like food in 10 days. |
| Tentacle Spike | 100 | Dropped by [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacles "Tentacles"). |
| Dark Sword | 100 | Drains [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"). |
| Boomerang | 10 | Ranged, must be caught. |
| Bat Bat | 75 | Leeches [health](/wiki/Health "Health") at cost of [sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"). |
| Tooth Trap | 10 | Damages [mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") that walk over it. |
| Thulecite Club | 150 | Spawns shadow tentacles on hit |
| Pan Flute | 10 | Puts nearby [mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") to sleep. |

## Protection[]

Protective items include [Armors](/wiki/Armor "Armor") and [Walls](/wiki/Walls "Walls"). Armors are items worn by the player. Armor's durability functions like extra [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") for the character wearing it. Each type of Armor ([Grass Suit](/wiki/Grass_Suit "Grass Suit"), [Log Suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit"), or [Marble Suit](/wiki/Marble_Suit "Marble Suit")) can absorb a certain amount of damage before breaking (225, 450, and 1050 respectively). When a character is hit, the armor takes a percentage of the total damage and the characters health takes the remainder. The number show on the armor's inventory icon is not actually the amount of damage it can still absorb, but the percentage of its own starting health (for example if a Grass Suit shows it has 50% durability left, it can still absorb 112 damage before breaking). Walls can be placed to protect or limit access to an area from other mobs. They can be attacked and destroyed, but can be repaired and even upgraded to last longer. [Stone Walls](/wiki/Stone_Wall "Stone Wall") and [Thulecite Walls](/wiki/Thulecite_Wall "Thulecite Wall") are the only non-flammable walls.[True durability](/wiki/Armor/DST#True_durability "Armor/DST") of armors, in this page you can find numbers for calculating.

| Name | % Absorbed | Durability | Special |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Grass Suit | 60% | 225 |  |
| Log Suit | 80% | 450 |  |
| Marble Suit | 95% | 1050 | 30% Speed Reduction. |
| Night Armour | 95% | 750 | Drains [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"). |
| Snurtle Shell Armor | 80% | 1050 | Absorbs 100% damage while hiding inside. |
| Thulecite Suit | 90% | 1800 | Moderate sanity gain. |
| Football Helmet | 80% | 450 |  |
| Beekeeper Hat | 80% | 750 | Only protects against Bees and Killer Bees. |
| Shelmet | 90% | 750 |  |
| Thulecite Crown | 90% | 1200 | Summons protective forcefield. |
| Hay Wall | 100% | 50-100 | Flammable. |
| Wood Wall | 100% | 100-200 | Flammable. |
| Stone Wall | 100% | 200-400 | Non-flammable. |
| Thulecite Wall | 100% | 500-800 | Non-flammable. |

## Clothing[]

The durability of [clothing](/wiki/Clothing "Clothing") indicates the amount of wear-and-tear the clothing has suffered. When equipped, a piece of clothing will gradually wear out, and its durability will decrease. Each clothing item wears at a different rate, so if a vest and a hat are equipped at the same time, one may wear out before the other. Additionally, clothing is the only item type which can have its durability restored, which is done by using the [Sewing Kit](/wiki/Sewing_Kit "Sewing Kit").

| Name | Wear Time | Special |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Garland | 6 Days | Minor sanity gain, spoils like [food](/wiki/Food "Food"). |
| Dapper Vest | 10 Days | Moderate sanity gain, minor insulation. |
| Breezy Vest | 15 Days | Mediocre sanity gain, minor insulation. |
| Puffy Vest | 15 Days | Mediocre sanity gain, great insulation. |
| Rabbit Earmuffs | 5 Days | Minor insulation. |
| Top Hat | 8 Days | Moderate sanity gain. |
| Feather Hat | 8 Days | More [birds](/wiki/Birds "Birds") land, mediocre sanity gain. |
| Winter Hat | 10 Days | Minor sanity gain, moderate insulation. |
| Beefalo Hat | 10 Days | Massive insulation, [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") don't attack during mating season. |
| Tam o' Shanter | 25 Days | Massive sanity gain, great insulation. |
| Belt of Hunger | 8 Days | Hunger loss is slowed by 60%, mediocre sanity gain. |
| One-man Band | 3 min | Makes up to 9 followers out of [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") and [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") at the expense of sanity. |
| Spiderhat | 2 min | Makes followers out of [Spiders](/wiki/Category:Spiders "Category:Spiders") at the expense of sanity. |

## Amulets and staves[]

[Staves](/wiki/Category:Staves "Category:Staves") lose durability when they are used while [Amulets](/wiki/Category:Amulets "Category:Amulets") usually lose it over time while being worn. [Chilled Amulets](/wiki/Chilled_Amulet "Chilled Amulet") and [Nightmare Amulets](/wiki/Nightmare_Amulet "Nightmare Amulet") wear out in the same way as clothing, staves wear out as weapons or tools and [Life Giving Amulet](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet") will lose durability itself by healing the character every 30 seconds if their health is not full.
