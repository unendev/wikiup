The **Pith Pike** is an item added to The Forge in Don't Starve Together. Available immediately from Wigfrid when playing as her.

This item is a melee weapon. When attacking, the character swings his pike and deals 25 damage to the target.

The main ability of the powerful pike is a fiery dash (Pyre Poker). When used, a character makes a dash forward, causing damage to all enemies in the path of the dash. This ability is capable of flipping over Snortoises, rendering them unable to attack or move for long periods of time.

## Prototype Tips[]

* This weapon is the most powerful starting weapon of all. In the initial stages of the battle with the army of the Warlord, you can increase the damage of the pike even more by wearing a spiked helmet and / or sharp-toothed wood armor.
* Unlike the hammer of the Crucible, the powerful pike does not penetrate the armor of enemy warriors. It is recommended to focus the attack on the creature that the player with the hammer is attacking in order to deal more damage.
* If the team does not have a character with a tome of petrification, on wave 7 you can turn over a small group of grunts so that they do not interfere with the team dealing with the rest.
