Walter has a [Trusty Slingshot](/wiki/Trusty_Slingshot "Trusty Slingshot") as an exclusive weapon with special [Slingshot Ammo](/wiki/Slingshot_Ammo "Slingshot Ammo") with varying effects. This weapon has no durability, but can still be crafted. Walter has access to an exclusive [Slingshot Ammo Tab](/wiki/Slingshot_Ammo_Tab "Slingshot Ammo Tab") to craft ammo, crafting each type of ammo will create 10 pieces.

He can also exclusively craft a portable [Camper's Tent](/wiki/Tent_Roll "Tent Roll"). It functions as a [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent") with the portability of a [Fur Roll](/wiki/Fur_Roll "Fur Roll") and has 10 uses.

He has a [Pinetree Pioneer Hat](/wiki/Pinetree_Pioneer_Hat "Pinetree Pioneer Hat") that reduces sanity drain from receiving damage by half. Furthermore, the sanity drain from missing health is reduced to 25% of its usual strength. He starts with one in his inventory, and can craft additional ones using 4 silk.

[Woby](/wiki/Woby "Woby") is a special [Mob](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") that follows him around. She has 9 inventory slots, like [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester"). She can be fed [Monster Food](/wiki/Monster_Food "Monster Food") to transform into big Woby. Walter can mount big Woby like a [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo"). While riding Big Woby, Walter is unable to attack with any weapon, save for the Slingshot. Additionally, if Woby takes damage while Walter is riding her, she will buck him off, which will often result in Walter taking extra hits during the animation.

He does not lose sanity from negative aura effects such as Dusk/Night, monsters, [Night Light](/wiki/Night_Light "Night Light") or [Nightmare Light](/wiki/Nightmare_Light "Nightmare Light"). He also is not affected by sanity effect (negative or positive) from equipped items like [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter"), [Spiderhat](/wiki/Spiderhat "Spiderhat"), [Seawreath](/wiki/Seawreath "Seawreath") or any other equipped items that are wet (he still suffers sanity drain when being wet himself). Walter's fearlessness however is not strong enough to protect him from shadow magic, hence he is affected by sanity drain/gain of the following items: [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword"), [Night Armor](/wiki/Night_Armor "Night Armor"), [Amulets](/wiki/Amulet "Amulet"), [Belt of Hunger](/wiki/Belt_of_Hunger "Belt of Hunger"), [Thulecite Suit](/wiki/Thulecite_Suit "Thulecite Suit"). He will still lose sanity from sources that instantaneously take away sanity, e.g.: picking up Evil Flowers, Telepoofing with [The Lazy Explorer](/wiki/The_Lazy_Explorer "The Lazy Explorer"), eating certain foods, etc. Also he does not lose sanity when traveling through [Worm Hole](/wiki/Worm_Hole "Worm Hole") or [Portal](/wiki/Backtrek_Watch "Backtrek Watch") or when there is any [Ghost Characters](/wiki/Ghost_Characters "Ghost Characters").

Like [Willow](/wiki/Willow "Willow") and [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly"), Walter cooks food over fire faster than other characters, he only takes half as long (0.5 seconds) as other Characters (1 second) to cook food. In addition, he is able to use [Willow's Lighter](/wiki/Willow%27s_Lighter "Willow's Lighter") to cook food.

He loses only half the normal [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") when [Sleeping](/wiki/Sleeping "Sleeping").

Walter is able to restore +6 Sanity/min and receives only half the sanity drain from missing health when there are more than 5 [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree") within a radius of 2.5 tiles around him.

During the [Night](/wiki/Night "Night"), Walter can tell stories at a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") or [Endothermic Fire](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire "Endothermic Fire") by simply right-clicking on them. It generates a sanity aura of +10 Sanity/min for himself and all other survivors close to the fire.

## Disadvantage[]

Walter loses sanity when he loses health, the amount of sanity lost corresponding to twice the health lost. For damage over time (such as when [Starving](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"), [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing"), or [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating")) the sanity loss is equal to the health loss. The [Pinetree Pioneer Hat](/wiki/Pinetree_Pioneer_Hat "Pinetree Pioneer Hat") halves the sanity lost from receiving damage.

Walter continuously loses sanity while his health is not full, up to -12 Sanity/min proportionally to his missing Health (0.2 sanity per 1 hp missing). The sanity drain is quartered when wearing a [Pinetree Pioneer Hat](/wiki/Pinetree_Pioneer_Hat "Pinetree Pioneer Hat") or halved when near enough [Trees](/wiki/Tree "Tree") (does not stack, [Pinetree Pioneer Hat](/wiki/Pinetree_Pioneer_Hat "Pinetree Pioneer Hat") takes priority).

Walter's allergy makes him take 10 extra damage from [Bees](/wiki/Bee "Bee") (Bees, [Killer Bees](/wiki/Killer_Bee "Killer Bee"), [Grumble Bees](/wiki/Grumble_Bee "Grumble Bee"), [Bee Queen](/wiki/Bee_Queen "Bee Queen")). This damage is not negated by armor.

Also, the sanity gain from clothing items have no effect on him. Other effects, such as the [Eyebrella](/wiki/Eyebrella "Eyebrella")'s rain protection still apply.

Because Walter has Woby, he is unable to adopt a pet from the [Critter Den](/wiki/Critters "Critters").
