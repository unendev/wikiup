**“**The water is too rough!**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

**Monsoon Season**, or **Green Season**, is a [Season](/wiki/Seasons "Seasons") in the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* DLC. It is equivalent to [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"). Monsoon Season is indicated with the world having bluish green tint. By default, it begins on day 37 and ends on day 56. During Monsoon Season, nights gradually become shorter with days becoming longer. Dusk stays longer.

[Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") will start to bloom during this season.

Rain during Monsoon Season causes patches of land to be flooded. The first days of monsoon seasons are relatively rain-free. However, as the season progresses, rain becomes more frequent and flooding worsens until most of the land is flooded during the end of the season. Lightning, while present, is less frequent than during [Hurricane Season](/wiki/Hurricane_Season "Hurricane Season") and [Strong Winds](/wiki/Strong_Winds "Strong Winds") do not occur. Frequent rain means [Crops](/wiki/Crops "Crops"), [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs") and other pickable plants will grow 33% faster.

Maximum chase time and range for enemies is increased by 33%. Trees take 25% less time to grow to next stage.

The rains in Monsoon Season come in waves. Each wave will increase the size of the puddle that will flood the areas. Using the Sandbags can permanently remove a puddle when done properly (see [Sandbags](/wiki/Sandbag "Sandbag") and [Flooding](/wiki/Flooding "Flooding") for more information). Certain structures will no longer function when in a puddle. This includes but is not limited to iceboxes, crockpots, alchemy engine, and prestihatitator.

If the player must venture into flooded zones, an [Umbrella](/wiki/Umbrella "Umbrella") combined with a hat with a water resistance rating such as a [Top Hat](/wiki/Top_Hat "Top Hat") or [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet") will prevent the player from getting wet. [Snakeskin Jackets](/wiki/Snakeskin_Jacket "Snakeskin Jacket") and [Hats](/wiki/Snakeskin_Hat "Snakeskin Hat") are good and cheap solutions to combat Wetness if no high-end gear were found from [X Marks the Spot](/wiki/X_Marks_the_Spot "X Marks the Spot") treasure chests. [Blubber Suits](/wiki/Blubber_Suit "Blubber Suit") and [Tar Suits](/wiki/Tar_Suit "Tar Suit") are perhaps the best gear because they completely make the player immune to Wetness, however they do not protect from lightning strikes.

[Poison Mosquitoes](/wiki/Poison_Mosquito "Poison Mosquito") start to appear during Monsoon Season spawning in the flooded areas. [Lureplants](/wiki/Meat_Bulb_(Lureplant) "Meat Bulb (Lureplant)") will also begin to spawn in this season, rendering player-made flooring very effective to combat both puddles and Lureplants.

Like in [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"), normal [Bees](/wiki/Bee "Bee") become aggressive towards the player. [Crabbit Dens](/wiki/Crabbit_Den "Crabbit Den") collapse within the first days of this season. However, the [Sharkitten Den](/wiki/Sharkitten_Den "Sharkitten Den") opens up and a chance of [Tiger Shark](/wiki/Tiger_Shark "Tiger Shark") to spawn is the highest.

[Trawl Net](/wiki/Trawl_Net "Trawl Net") fishing yields as much catch as during [Mild Season](/wiki/Mild_Season "Mild Season").

Monsoon Season is followed by [Dry Season](/wiki/Dry_Season "Dry Season"). Long-term goal of Monsoon Season is to prepare for Dry Season in advance. It is more easily done within the first half of the season where flooding is not much of an issue and rains are not very frequent.
