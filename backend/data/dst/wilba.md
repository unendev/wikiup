Wilba starts as a passive, non-attacking [Mob](/wiki/Mob "Mob") in the Souvenir Shop located two rooms to the left in the [Royal Palace](/wiki/Palace "Palace") on the second island. She tells the player that she lost the [Royal Crown](/wiki/Royal_Crown "Royal Crown") and is therefore grounded. The player must kill the [Queen Womant](/wiki/Queen_Womant "Queen Womant") and mine its throne with a [Pickaxe](/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe") to get the [Royal Crown](/wiki/Royal_Crown "Royal Crown"). Return the [Royal Crown](/wiki/Royal_Crown "Royal Crown") to the Pig Queen. Once the player does this, Wilba will be unlocked as a playable character and disappear from her room.

## Trivia[]

* Wilba was added to the Early Access of *Don't Starve: Hamlet* on [November 8, 2018](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet#November_8.2C_2018 "Don't Starve: Hamlet").
* Wilba's voice is played by an Ocarina.[[1]](#cite_note-1)
* In the forum post introducing her as a playable character, she is described as follows: "*Daughter to Queen Malfalfa, Princess Wilba has the love of her people. If only she wanted the job. She would much rather be out in the world exploring and soaking up life, even if she still requires a nightlight when she gets tucked in.*"[[2]](#cite_note-2)
* Wilba's style of speech is a parody of archaic (Shakespeare's) English. Other *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* Pigs also speak this way.
* The player is able to kill Wilba before unlocking her in the Palace. She will drop one [Pig Skin](/wiki/Pig_Skin "Pig Skin") and one [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat"). Once she has been killed, she will never respawn, forcing the player to create another world to unlock her.
* Wilba, [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood"), [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox"), and [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt") may be the first survivors to originate from the [Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant") itself and not from the original world like the others.
* Her hair, skirt, and bow have bones, as shown when struck by lightning.
* Wilba may be a reference to the protagonist of *Charlotte's Web* due to the fact she is also a pig, and similarly named "Wilbur".
* If Wilba drops an [Oinc](/wiki/Oinc "Oinc") (from her inventory or from hammering down a decoration) and a guard picks it up, all nearby guards will attack the thieving guard.
* In the forum post introducing her Werepig condition, the following is said in order to explain her power: "*Wilba has inherited one of her father's more colourful characteristics, namely, she now carries the same curse that inflicts all of her father's family with dreaded werepigism.*".[[3]](#cite_note-3)
* Wilba's Werepig form was added in the [February 7th, 2019](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet#February_7th,_2019 "Don't Starve: Hamlet") update, also known as the Character Update.

* [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider") won't attack Wilba in her Werepig form on sight. It is unclear whether it is a bug or not.
* Wilba is the first female character in solo Don't Starve to have dot eyes.
