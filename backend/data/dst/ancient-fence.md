The **Ancient Fence** is an [indestructible](/wiki/Category:Indestructible_Object "Category:Indestructible Object") [Structure](/wiki/Structures "Structures") exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, introduced in *[A New Reign](/wiki/A_New_Reign "A New Reign")*. It is found in the [Atrium](/wiki/Atrium "Atrium") biome. It is normally raised, preventing mobs from passing through. When approached by a player, it will lower and allow passage. After the player moves out of range, it will raise again. If the [Ancient Key](/wiki/Ancient_Key "Ancient Key") has been inserted into the [Ancient Gateway](/wiki/Ancient_Gateway "Ancient Gateway"), the Ancient Fence will glow red and remain raised.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Before the 3/23/2017 hotfix, [ghost players](/wiki/Ghost_Characters "Ghost Characters") were able to haunt Ancient Fences.
