## Game Screen[]

The picture below is a labeled game screen with HUD, short for Heads-Up-Display. (note: Sanity/Hunger wrong way around)

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/26/Game Screen.png/revision/latest?cb=20130416023923 

Players' normal game screen.

 

**[Health](/wiki/Health "Health"):**

Displays how much damage the player can take. When it reaches 0, it causes the player's [Death](/wiki/Death "Death") or Resurrection.

**[Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"):**

Track how full the player's stomach is. When empty, the player will experience constant health loss (similar to [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") or [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") ). This will continue until the player consumes a [Food](/wiki/Food "Food") [item](/wiki/Item "Item") that refills hunger or dies.

**[Spoilage](/wiki/Spoilage "Spoilage"):**

If the player keeps food for too long without eating it, the food item will begin to spoil and rot. The item in the inventory will start as a fresh (Green) item if it can spoil. It will first turn stale (Yellow), then spoil (Red), and finally turn into an inedible pile of [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot") which can be used as weak [fertilizer](/wiki/Fertilizer "Fertilizer") for [Farms](/wiki/Farms "Farms") and [Plants](/wiki/Plants "Plants").

Each stage of spoilage will diminish the positive effects of the food and will eventually add a negative effect to it (i.e., [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") loss). These effects do not apply to [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78").

The spoilage rate will double if the food is left on the ground, or it can be cut in half if it is placed in an [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box"). You can also give it more durability by stacking it with fresher food.

DLCs and DST introduce the [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") mechanic, causing food to become wet if not protected. Soggy food spoils 30% faster.

**[Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"):**

This keeps track of the player's current Sanity level. When Sanity drops, numerous things happen based on the current amount. As it falls, the screen will begin to distort and shake, and eyes will soon begin to appear at night (Sanity ≤ 60%). The distortion will continue until the Sanity level falls below 50%. Below this, the player can see [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") (shadow-like monsters and [Beardlings](/wiki/Rabbit#Beardling "Rabbit")). If their Sanity level drops below 15%, the [character](/wiki/Characters "Characters") will start to hold their head in pain, and the Shadow Creatures will begin to attack the player without provocation (except for Beardlings).

Common actions that will reduce a player's Sanity are eating raw [Meats](/wiki/Meats "Meats") and [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat"), traveling through [Worm Holes](/wiki/Worm_Holes "Worm Holes"), staying in complete darkness, or fighting certain [monsters](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters"). Actions that will increase the player's Sanity are eating [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") food (like [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy") and [Pumpkin Cookies](/wiki/Pumpkin_Cookies "Pumpkin Cookies")), eating [Cooked](/wiki/Cooked "Cooked") food, picking [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower"), wearing certain [Dress](/wiki/Dress "Dress") items, [sleeping](/wiki/Sleep "Sleep") through the night, etc.

**[Day/Night cycle](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle"):**

On the HUD, a circular object will show the player exactly how much in-game time they will have left before the time of day changes to [Dusk](/wiki/Dusk "Dusk"), [Night](/wiki/Night "Night"), or [Day](/wiki/Day "Day").

The day will slowly turn to Dusk, then Night, and then again back to Day. This cycle will repeat infinitely, but the length of each stage will change depending on the current [season](/wiki/Seasons "Seasons") (see below).

**[Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") & [Winter:](/wiki/Winter "Winter")**

Summer and Winter are the two seasons in *Don't Starve* (there are four in the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC as well as DST; [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn") and [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring")). During these seasons, the amount of Day, Dusk, and Night that will be left in a Day will differ.

Summer does not have much of a change from the game's normal state besides the change in Day times. Winter, however, is drastically different.

During Winter:

* The types of [Animals](/wiki/Animals "Animals") and [Monsters](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters") will either change entirely or just their coat color

* The player is capable of [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") to death

* The hostile [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops") boss will occasionally spawn

* The duo of [Mactusk N' Son](/wiki/Mactusk_N%27_Son "Mactusk N' Son") will spawn from [Walrus Camps](/wiki/Walrus_Camp "Walrus Camp") (with 2 [Blue Hounds](/wiki/Hound#Blue_Hound "Hound"))

Winter is a very hostile season, so it is recommended that the player prepare before it begins. One of the easiest way is hunting a [Koalefant](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant") before the night starts. When you find it, wait until night and kill it while it's sleeping. You will get a [Koalefant Trunk](/wiki/Koalefant_Trunk "Koalefant Trunk") which with 8 [Silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk") can be turned into a [Breezy Vest](/wiki/Breezy_Vest "Breezy Vest"). A Winter Koalefant Trunk can be turned crafted into a [Puffy Vest](/wiki/Puffy_Vest "Puffy Vest") using 8 Silk and 2 [Beefalo Wool](/wiki/Beefalo_Wool "Beefalo Wool").

**[Moon Cycle](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle"):**

If players are looking at the [Clock](/wiki/Clock "Clock") at night, a small moon phase can be observed. On a full moon, normal [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") will become [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepigs "Werepigs"), which are hostile and dangerous to players. Therefore, it is recommended that players not visit [Pig Villages](/wiki/Pig_Village "Pig Village") or befriend [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") on a full moon. If the player's camp resides near a Pig Village or in the center of one, the light produced during the full moon segment can be used to escape from the Village before the Pigs transform. In *Reign of Giants,* however, many things can happen on a full moon, which can be observed by going into a [Deciduous Forest](/wiki/Deciduous_Forest "Deciduous Forest"). The first change is that it is bright enough for you to stray from your [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") without being affected by Sanity loss or [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie"). Additionally, [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushroom "Mushroom") grow into [Mushtrees](/wiki/Mushtree "Mushtree"), Flowers turn into Evil Flowers and a unique item, [Glommer's Flower](/wiki/Glommer%27s_Flower "Glommer's Flower"), appears near [Glommer's Statue](/wiki/Glommer%27s_Statue "Glommer's Statue").

**Equipped Items:**

:   **On Hand:** For wielding [Tools](/wiki/Tools "Tools"), [Weapons](/wiki/Weapons "Weapons"), or [Magical](/wiki/Magic "Magic") items.

:   **Body:** For wearing [Armour](/wiki/Armour "Armour"), [Dress items](/wiki/Dress "Dress"), Magical apparel, or different types of [Backpacks](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") on the torso.

:   **Hat:** For wearing [Armour](/wiki/Armour "Armour") or [Hats](/wiki/Dress "Dress") on the head.

**[Minimap](/wiki/Map "Map"):**

Activated by pressing the Tab key on PC, View button on Xbox One, or the touchpad on PS4.

The Minimap shows the player their location and notable items ([Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Dens "Spider Dens"), [Boulders](/wiki/Boulders "Boulders"), [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King"), [Fire Pit](/wiki/Fire_Pit "Fire Pit"), etc.) The map fills in when it is explored in the world.

**[Game Tabs](/wiki/Tabs "Tabs"):**

Tabs that are used to [Craft](/wiki/Crafting "Crafting") different objects (if the player has the correct resources). It also shows what items need to be unlocked and which resources are needed to unlock them.

**Pause:**

Used to stop the game and choose an option from the HUD (Options, Save & Quit, or Continue.) The shortcut to do this is pressing the Esc key. This can be done on the Pocket Edition version of Don't Starve by pressing the pause button on the bottom right-hand corner.

**[Prototype](/wiki/Prototype "Prototype"):**

The method used to unlock craftable items. Players must gather enough resources before unlocking/prototyping an item. A type of [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") must be used for prototyping. Prototyping will increase your sanity a little.

If players have any inquiry, please feel free to read articles in the gameplay mechanics bar below or make comment below the page, editors will reply to your question.

## Day 1[]

The player does not start with any items, aside from some [character-specific items](/wiki/Category:Character-Specific "Category:Character-Specific"). The first major concerns for players are [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"), Night, And Sanity

### During daytime[]

1. Pick up [Flint](/wiki/Flint "Flint") and [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs") for crafting a [Pickaxe](/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe") and an [Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe") in the https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/4d/Icon Tools.png/revision/latest?cb=20210625093434 tab.
2. Collect [Cut Grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass") from [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft") and chop [Trees](/wiki/Trees "Trees") for [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log"). They will be used for crafting a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") at night.
3. Collect [Carrots](/wiki/Carrots "Carrots") and [Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries") to cook over the Campfire in the evening.
4. Continue with this until through the day and most of the [Dusk](/wiki/Dusk "Dusk"). Then you have two options:

* Option 1: Find a place to settle down and then build a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") in the https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/30/Icon Light.png/revision/latest?cb=20210625093003 tab. Make sure to keep your fire burning throughout the night by adding occasional logs to it. A Campfire is the best option if you want to chop down trees, mine rocks and cook food during the night (if you want to conserve fuel, cook food later when the fire has gotten smaller). A well-stocked fire will prevent [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") from murdering you in the dark. When it's not raining, the Campfire will provide just enough light to last through the night although a log or two should be added if you want to light surrounding areas. Stay as close to the fire as possible to prevent loss of [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity").
* Option 2: Make sure you have materials for at least a couple of [Torches](/wiki/Torch "Torch") which must be equipped just when the night arrives. A Torch allows continued exploration and resource gathering during nighttime. Contrast to what it may seem, nights aren't that much more dangerous apart from darkness. If you keep away from the [Marsh](/wiki/Marsh "Marsh") [biome](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes"), the only enemies that you might worry about are [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider") that can be easily avoided. During the night you should also try to eat your cooked food, you will need the day and dusk to gather resources

Try this strategy:

1. Gather everything in sight. You will need 12 [Flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") to construct a [Garland](/wiki/Garland "Garland") to keep your Sanity up (WAIT until Day 4 or 5 to start gathering flowers when your Sanity goes down, picking a flower gives 5 sanity which is good for quick sanity recovery. It is recommended to pick just enough for your sanity needs as flowers once picked take a few days to re-spawn). You will also need lots of [Cut Grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass"), [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs"), and [food](/wiki/Food "Food") such as [Carrots](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot") and [Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries").
2. When [Night](/wiki/Night "Night") comes, build a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") near big trees to efficiently spend nighttime chopping trees. Alternatively, you can craft Torches and burn the trees, being careful not to pick dense tree areas, for they will all catch on fire. Pick a lone tree with a 2x2 range from the next tree. Burn tree after tree until sunrise. Use an [Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe") to cut down the burnt trees and collect [Charcoal](/wiki/Charcoal "Charcoal"). Try to get at least six Charcoal in the first night.

### Don'ts[]

* DON'T attack [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders") or [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Dens "Spider Dens"). Attacking a den will aggro all spiders in the den (3-9, depending on the size of the nest). It will be very dangerous for beginners if they are not well-equipped.
* DON'T attack [Bees](/wiki/Bees "Bees") or [Bee Hives](/wiki/Bee_Hives "Bee Hives"). Attacking the hive will cause surrounding bees to become angry. Also, [Killer Bees](/wiki/Killer_Bees "Killer Bees") will spawn and attack [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") proactively.
* DON'T attack a [Tallbird](/wiki/Tallbird "Tallbird") or take their [Tallbird Egg](/wiki/Tallbird_Egg "Tallbird Egg"). They cause great damage to players' [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") and they will chase players for long distances.
* DON'T attack [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo"), as they are useful for producing infinite [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure").
* DON'T travel through the [Marsh](/wiki/Marsh "Marsh"); dangerous [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacles "Tentacles"), [Merms](/wiki/Merms "Merms"), and [Mosquitoes](/wiki/Mosquito "Mosquito") may easily kill beginners.

And most importantly:

* DON'T STARVE!

**Note:** Only attack these monsters if players are well-equipped to fight them, for example, having a [Log Suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit"), a [Spear](/wiki/Spear "Spear") and a [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet"). Also, prepare enough food ([Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries"), etc.) and/or healing items.

The Marsh is a dangerous place, but you will need the [Reeds](/wiki/Reeds "Reeds") that grow there. Avoid [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacles "Tentacles") that can be seen hiding in the ground as you approach them. Be very careful! The Marsh is the most dangerous area in the early-game.

### Do's[]

* DO collect lots of [Pine Cones](/wiki/Pine_Cone "Pine Cone"), it is useful to avoid traveling far for [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log"), and to tame [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguards "Treeguards").
* DO start building a base near [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") or [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig"), they are some of the only sources of [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure"). Beware that Beefalo may attack players when they are in mating season, and that Pigs will turn into [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepigs "Werepigs") on a full moon. Players may have to acquire a [Beefalo Hat](/wiki/Beefalo_Hat "Beefalo Hat") in advance, either from crafting or by finding one in a [Set Piece](/wiki/Set_Piece "Set Piece").
* DO try to attack [Birds](/wiki/Bird "Bird"). Although they may not be killed, they leave [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") behind which can be planted in [Farms](/wiki/Farm "Farm"). It is possible to kill Birds using Seeds to lure them and a [Weapon](/wiki/Weapon "Weapon").

## Day 2-7[]

Similar to Day 1. However, players are recommended to do the following things:

* Continue to explore as much as possible to find key resources.
* Open up crafting options, like finding sources of [Gold Nuggets](/wiki/Gold_Nugget "Gold Nugget") for [Science](/wiki/Science_Tab "Science Tab") items like the [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine"), and [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure") to open up [Farming](/wiki/Farming "Farming").

### More Tips[]

* At night, when you can't find a good base around the early days (Day 2+), make a Torch and continue exploring. The more you expand your [Map](/wiki/Map "Map"), the better of an idea on where you want to set a [Fire Pit](/wiki/Fire_Pit "Fire Pit"). It is best to follow [Roads](/wiki/Road "Road") with a Torch while constantly checking the [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") to avoid hostile [Monsters](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters") like [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider"). Materials for a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") can be helpful, should your Torch run low.
* Create a [Pickaxe](/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe") in the https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/4d/Icon Tools.png/revision/latest?cb=20210625093434 tab. Mine [Boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder") for [Gold Nuggets](/wiki/Gold_Nugget "Gold Nugget"), and create a [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") in the https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/e/e7/Icon Science.png/revision/latest?cb=20210625093124 tab.
* Prototype [Rope](/wiki/Rope "Rope") in the https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/2/2f/Icon Refine.png/revision/latest?cb=20210625093102 tab for crafting the [Log Suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit") and [Spear](/wiki/Spear "Spear") in the https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/bb/Icon Fight.png/revision/latest?cb=20210625092905 tab. These will help you survive against [Hounds](/wiki/Hounds "Hounds") and [bosses](/wiki/Category:Boss_Monsters "Category:Boss Monsters").
* Explore for an area that has [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") ([Savanna](/wiki/Savanna "Savanna")), because lots of [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure") can be found and they are important to build [Farms](/wiki/Farm "Farm"), as well as being usable for [fertilizing](/wiki/Farming#Fertilizers "Farming") crops.
* When the [Hounds](/wiki/Hounds "Hounds") appear, to avoid taking damage, try to find a nearby Beefalo herd, not in mating season, and avoid getting hit.
* Avoid the more dangerous enemies ([Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacles "Tentacles"), [Spider Warriors](/wiki/Spider_Warriors "Spider Warriors"), etc.) until the player has created a [Life Giving Amulet](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet") or a [Meat Effigy](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy") or found a [Touch Stone](/wiki/Touch_Stone "Touch Stone").
* Whenever you're fighting enemies, keep an eye on [Spear](/wiki/Spear "Spear") and [Armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor") durability.
* If exploring, don't forget to return and replace any checkable [Traps](/wiki/Traps "Traps").
* Heal [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") by killing [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterfly "Butterfly") and eating the dropped [Butterfly Wings](/wiki/Butterfly_Wings "Butterfly Wings"), eating Roasted Berries, or killing [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders") for [Spider Glands](/wiki/Spider_Gland "Spider Gland") (a single spider can easily be stun-locked to death with 3 hits of the spear).
* Explore as much as possible before setting camp. A great camping spot should be centered around a good list of the following: Touch Stone, Pigs/Beefalo, a Savannah with lots of Grass/[Rabbit Holes](/wiki/Rabbit_Hole "Rabbit Hole"), a [Worm Hole](/wiki/Worm_Hole "Worm Hole"), loads of Boulders and Trees. Priorities such as Beehives, Marsh, [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves"), [Things](/wiki/Thing "Thing"), [Walrus Camps](/wiki/Walrus_Camp "Walrus Camp") and [Tallbird Nests](/wiki/Tallbird_Nest "Tallbird Nest") should be left alone until the later days when you don't have to worry about Health, Hunger, Sanity and basic materials.
* Players may befriend [Pigs](/wiki/Pigs "Pigs") by giving them any [Meats](/wiki/Meats "Meats") or [Eggs](/wiki/Eggs "Eggs"). Once befriended, they can help chop down trees and fight against [Monsters](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters"). They might be very helpful to beginners, but players must remember that Pigs will turn into [Werepigs](/wiki/Werepig "Werepig") during a full moon.
* Try to find the [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King") and a [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") herd as soon as possible. The Pig King will give you Gold Nuggets in exchange for [Meats](/wiki/Meats "Meats"), [Eggs](/wiki/Egg "Egg") and [Trinkets](/wiki/Trinkets "Trinkets"). However, don't build too close to the Pig King, as the Pigs can turn into Werepigs.
* Build your base close to a Beefalo herd, but be at least 1 biome away as Beefalo in heat will attack you.

Meanwhile, players are not recommended to consume [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") (unless playing as [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber")), and instead save it to feed Pigs (especially if you want to fight Werepigs for collecting more loot); otherwise just let it turn into [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot") as fertilizer for [Farming](/wiki/Farming "Farming") or use it in a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") to get rid of the negative effects.

## Day 7+[]

Once a suitable location is found,

* Set up a base with a [Fire Pit](/wiki/Fire_Pit "Fire Pit") (a permanent structure)
* Set up a [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") for prototyping useful [Items](/wiki/Items "Items")

The Fire Pit is much better than the regular [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") because players can see it on the map and if it goes out, players can restart it with [fuel](/wiki/Fuel "Fuel"). Also, players may build infinite food supplies like:

* Building [Farms](/wiki/Farms "Farms") for planting [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") in the https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/72/Icon Food.png/revision/latest?cb=20210625092935 tab.
* Building [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") for making better food in the https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/72/Icon Food.png/revision/latest?cb=20210625092935 tab.
* Collecting [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bushes "Berry Bushes"), [Saplings](/wiki/Saplings "Saplings") and [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft") with a [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel") in the https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/4d/Icon Tools.png/revision/latest?cb=20210625093434 tab.

However, players should be aware of lightning, as it may burn Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts and other [plants](/wiki/Plants "Plants"). Players may build a [Lightning Rod](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod") to prevent wildfires. At the same time, continue to set traps for Rabbits and collect [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") and [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure") for farm plots. Any [Beehives](/wiki/Beehives "Beehives") encountered need to be destroyed and rebuilt as [Bee Boxes](/wiki/Bee_Box "Bee Box"). Players may need a [Beekeeper Hat](/wiki/Beekeeper_Hat "Beekeeper Hat") in advance. Note that players need to capture [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterflies "Butterflies") by using [Bug Net](/wiki/Bug_Net "Bug Net"), then plant them as [Flower](/wiki/Flower "Flower") nearby [Bee Boxes](/wiki/Bee_Box "Bee Box"). The [Bees](/wiki/Bee "Bee") can only produce [Honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey") after pollinating 8 [Flowers](/wiki/Flowers "Flowers").

Players may continue to mine or look for the [Pig King](/wiki/Pig_King "Pig King"), and exchange [Meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") for Gold Nuggets to use for more efficient tools. De-construct some [Pig Houses](/wiki/Pig_Houses "Pig Houses") with the [Hammer](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer"). Continue to explore the map and bring back any resources found, be sure to immorally dig up any [Grave](/wiki/Grave "Grave") you find as you may obtain a [Life Giving Amulet](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet"), but keep an eye on your [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"). With all of the traps, food should not be an issue and with Bee Boxes you should be able to avoid dying.

* Craft some [armor](/wiki/Category:Armor "Category:Armor") for self-protection from [Hounds](/wiki/Hounds "Hounds")

Since [Hounds](/wiki/Hounds "Hounds") are more likely to appear during this time, players may want to create a [Log Suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit") and a [Spear](/wiki/Spear "Spear"). With these items, players are able to kill [Monsters](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters") easily and take loot from them.

Around day 16, players may create a [Meat Effigy](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy") in the https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/4d/Icon Magic.png/revision/latest?cb=20210625093022 tab (but players will lose 30 from their maximum [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") for each Meat Effigy built):

* For [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") - shave your [Beard](/wiki/Beard "Beard")
* For other [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") - get yourself to under 40% Sanity and kill [Beardlings](/wiki/Beardlings "Beardlings") for [Beard Hair](/wiki/Beard "Beard")

If available, always bring a [Life Giving Amulet](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet") with you. Be sure to wear it when in real danger, as simply having it in the inventory will not resurrect the player. However, the Meat Effigy will automatically resurrect the player on death when created.
