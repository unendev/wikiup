**“**One scan with this Calibrated Perceiver, and I'll know how somethin's built!**”**

–[Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona")

The **Calibrated Perceiver** is an [item](/wiki/Item "Item") exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, introduced in the *[Return of Them](/wiki/Return_of_Them "Return of Them")* updates and reused in the *[Skill Spotlight Updates](/wiki/Skill_Spotlight_Update "Skill Spotlight Update")* as a new item. It can only be obtained by [Winona](/wiki/Winona/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Winona/Don't Starve Together") after learning the [Founder's Keepers I](/wiki/Founder%27s_Keepers_I "Founder's Keepers I") skill. One Calibrated Perceiver drops from a [Cachebox](/wiki/Cachebox "Cachebox"), which can be found by wearing [Inspectacles](/wiki/Inspectacles "Inspectacles"). When dropped on the ground, the Calibrated Perceiver will disappear after a few seconds. Other [characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") cannot see or interact with it and it cannot be placed into containers such as [Backpacks](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") or [Chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest").

## Usage[]

The Calibrated Perceiver can be used to scan one item or structure that can be prototyped to obtain the corresponding recipe. It cannot be used to scan other characters' exclusive items or items that cannot be prototyped (like items, that can be crafted at a [Ancient Pseudoscience Station](/wiki/Ancient_Pseudoscience_Station "Ancient Pseudoscience Station") or a [Brightsmithy](/wiki/Brightsmithy "Brightsmithy")).

### Founder's Keepers II Founder's Keepers II[]

After learning the [Founder's Keepers II](/wiki/Founder%27s_Keepers_II "Founder's Keepers II") skill, Winona can use the Calibrated Perceiver to scan [Unstable Transmissions](/wiki/Unstable_Transmission "Unstable Transmission"). If the Unstable Transmission looks like a dismantled [Telipad](/wiki/Telipad "Telipad"), Winona will learn the [Teletransport Station](/wiki/Teletransport_Station "Teletransport Station") recipe. If the Unstable Transmission looks like an [Telebrella](/wiki/Telebrella "Telebrella"), Winona will learn the [Portasol](/wiki/Portasol "Portasol") recipe.

| Item scanned | Recipe learned for |
| --- | --- |
| Unstable Transmission | Teletransport Station [Teletransport Station](/wiki/Teletransport_Station "Teletransport Station") |
| Unstable Transmission | Portasol [Portasol](/wiki/Portasol "Portasol") |

## Tips[]

* The player can use the Calibrated Perceiver to scan the [Bundling Wrap](/wiki/Bundling_Wrap "Bundling Wrap") from the [Loot Stash](/wiki/Loot_Stash "Loot Stash") after killing [Klaus](/wiki/Klaus "Klaus").
* As Calibrated Perceivers do not stack and can't be stored, they can be dropped on the ground to get rid of them when there is nothing interesting to scan.
  + Enough Calibrated Perceivers can be found, as a new Cachebox spawns after 4 minutes.

## Trivia[]

* The Calibrated Perceiver was initially added in the *[Eye of the Storm](/wiki/Return_of_Them#Eye_of_the_Storm "Return of Them")* update as a part of the [Moonstorm](/wiki/Wagstaff/Grainy_Transmission#Moonstorm "Wagstaff/Grainy Transmission") quest.
  + Even though it has the same name and icon, the Calibrated Perceivers from Moonstorms cannot be used to scan items.
  + The Calibrated Perceiver Winona can find and use with her skill, was added in the *[Skill Spotlight: Wurt & Winona](/wiki/Skill_Spotlight_Update#Wurt_and_Winona "Skill Spotlight Update")* update.
