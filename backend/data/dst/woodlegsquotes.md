## Placeholder Trivia[]

* His examination quote for the End's Well ("Na'a drop ta'drink.") may be a reference to [Samuel Taylor Coleridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge "wikipedia:Samuel Taylor Coleridge")'s poem *[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner "wikipedia:The Rime of the Ancient Mariner")* (a modern version being "Water, water, everywhere, but not a drop to drink.").
* His quote for a Toucan ("Yer name wouldn't be Sam, would it?") is a reference to [Toucan Sam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toucan_Sam "wikipedia:Toucan Sam"), the cartoon mascot for [Froot Loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froot_Loops "wikipedia:Froot Loops") cereal.
* Woodlegs' quote for the Banana Pop ("I heard ther be gold in th'banana stand.") may be a reference to the Bluth's Original Frozen Banana Stand from the television show *[Arrested Development](https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/Bluth%27s_Original_Frozen_Banana_Stand)*, as one of the main characters frequently mentions that "there's always money in the banana stand".
