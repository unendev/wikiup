Please help to [improve the article](https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Belongings?action=edit), or discuss the issue with the community on the [comment section](#WikiaArticleComments). |

**Belongings** are a type of [Curio](/wiki/Curio_Cabinet "Curio Cabinet") in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* that allow the players to apply cosmetic Skins to certain [Items](/wiki/Item "Item"), [Structures](/wiki/Structure "Structure") and [Followers](/wiki/Category:Followers "Category:Followers") such as [Critters](/wiki/Critters "Critters"). The skins can be applied at the time of [Crafting](/wiki/Crafting "Crafting") and changed afterward by using a [Clean Sweeper](/wiki/Clean_Sweeper "Clean Sweeper"). This is also the only way to apply skins to items that cannot be crafted, such as the [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter"). They are stored in the [Curio Cabinet](/wiki/Curio_Cabinet "Curio Cabinet"), where the player can view their collection and preview skins not yet obtained.

Belongings are, alongside [Skins](/wiki/Skins "Skins"), the only Curios that can be used in the [Trade Inn](/wiki/Trade_Inn "Trade Inn") interface, where a player can exchange nine unwanted Belongings for a skin of higher [Rarity](/wiki/Curio_Cabinet "Curio Cabinet"). **Distinguished**, **Elegant**, **Loyal**, **Timeless**, **Event** or **Proof of Purchase** Belongings, as well as those with a **Woven** modifier, cannot be traded in.

## Cup[]

* The **Timeless Potato Cup.** The Potato Cup was added as an exclusive item in the [Steam inventory of the Klei developer Nome](https://steamcommunity.com/id/nomeconsulting/inventory/#322330). No other player is able to acquire the Potato Cup item. It is not known what item this skin is for and whether it can be used at all. In the incentive, he has a separate filter "Cup". Here is what Nom himself says about the Potato Cup: "Seth, the initial designer on DST, was once at a survival camp and failed at making a fire so he had nothing to cook his raw potato with. Raw potato is not something you want to eat. So instead he carved it into a cup and used it to drink water. He told that story on stream and everyone liked it, so when the time came to start making the skin system for DST I decided I wanted to be able to put a potato cup into Seth's steam inventory. So I dug a potato out of my garden, carved it into a cup, took a photo, and made it into a steam item which was the very first DST skin (it doesn't actually do anything in the game though because @PeterA is a big meanie)"[[1]](#cite_note-1)[[2]](#cite_note-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3)[[4]](#cite_note-4)

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The Scorching Satchel's description (*Dragon flier burning bright, in the desert quite a sight. What equipment is required to quench thy fearsome scorching fires?*) is a reference to William Blake's poem *[The Tyger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyger "wikipedia:The Tyger")*.
* The Floppy Straw Hat's description (*Be like a little British lady in your garden!*) may be a reference to the Bob's Burger's song *[Happy Crappy Place](https://genius.com/Bobs-burgers-happy-crappy-place-lyrics).*
* The Bumble Spear used to be called the Beeyonet.
* According to *Rhymes with Play* #181, the Poop Pouch backpack skin was designed by Toni.
* In one of the default loading screens, Wendy is pictured wearing a [Bigfoot](/wiki/Bigfoot "Bigfoot")-themed backpack with an [Old Bell](/wiki/Old_Bell "Old Bell") keychain. No such skin like this exists, and it is unknown if it ever will.
* All Backpack skins used to have a unique feature where if left on the ground for too long, they would start rotting and eventually turn into Moldy Backpacks. They could still be worn and used as a normal Backpack with no extra effects.
* The description for the Webrolly used to be "You'll never know when you arach-need one!".
* There is an unused description for the Woolly Eye Bone, as part of the Woolly Chester skin: "It's looking a bit sheepish."
* Banandana was originally meant to be a full item, not a skin. This was said on the *Rhymes With Play* stream dedicated to the update *The Curse of the Moon Quay*.
* Originally, there was an Emergency Exit skin for the bar, but later in [update 513864](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/141503-game-update-513864/?tab=comments#comment-1582281), it was merged with the Scrap Metal Boat skin for the boat. Everyone who bought this skin had it removed and, instead of the skin, they received 1,350 spools.
* "Mind's Eye Amulet" was formerly called "Mind's Eye Life Amulet". This was done in [update 521260](https://forums.kleientertainment.com/forums/topic/142959-game-update-521260/)
* The previous description of Mind's Eye Amulet was: "Tha best authors can breathe life into their subjects with but a few well-chosen words."
* Moggles 2.0 skin references the original design of [Moggles](/wiki/Moggles "Moggles")
* Initially, Moonlight Diaden skin featured a star instead of Alter's symbol. It was changed presumably due to associations with the Star of David. [[5]](#cite_note-5)

I suggest changing the shape of the star to be something more like these. both the portrait and skin for reference. note that the resemblance is more apparent in her portrait.
