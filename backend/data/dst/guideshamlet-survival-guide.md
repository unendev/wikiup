*With its unique mechanics, seasonal challenges, and abundance of mobs [Don't Starve: Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet") is considered a challenging yet throughly enjoyable DLC. While many useful guides and tutorials can be found online, I resorted to assembling my own here in Fandom in an effort to give back to a community that has helped me a lot while navigating the game. It is a work in progress and I thank you for your patience. Bear in mind that this article is a guide and therefore written from a subjective point of view. **This guide is meant for everyone new to Don't Starve: Hamlet, whether you've played another [Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve") game before or not.** For more information about how Hamlet, please refer to [Don't Starve: Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet") and the numerous and much useful articles on the Don't Starve Fandom Wiki.*

## Introduction to Don't Starve: Hamlet[]

### The bare basics[]

***In [Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve"), the world is your oyster - a very dangerous one, that is.*** In [Don't Starve: Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet"), as well as in the other [DLC](/wiki/DLC "DLC")s and the base game, players are free to explore and interact with the world as they please, with no established route or course of action besides each player's interests and goals. [The Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant") is a strange dimension where much can be learnt and discovered with little or no instruction from the game as to how, when, or even why to do so, but as you dive in the [Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve") universe you will start piecing together through experience a very large and fascinating picture.

But let's focus on staying alive first, because in order to progress in this universe, you'll obviously have to - and in [Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve"), [death](/wiki/Death "Death") is final, unless you find the means to unnaturally resurrect yourself. There are three aspects of yourself you'll have to mind in order to survive, and you can keep watch of them in your top right screen: [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"), [Health](/wiki/Health "Health"), and [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"). You will suffer damage to all three of them as you roam the world of Hamlet and encounter its numerous perils. The first, and most obvious of all, is the threat of starvation; since your spawn in the game your [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") will progressively drain until, yes, you starve, which will cause your [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") to drop to death. Your [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") will also be affected by taking damage from aggresive creatures and harmful items in a wide arrange of ways you'll have to learn to counteract and prevent. Similarly to your health, your [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") will also be affected in a variety of ways until you slowly become insane. While this does not directly drain your health, the monsters that'll appear once you go insane will, as does your next most obvious concern in this game: [darkness](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle"). Being in the dark is very dangerous in Don't Starve, folks, as it not only drains your Sanity, but the terrible [creatures](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") that inhabit it will make a target of your character once your screen goes black.

As you progress in the game, you will learn to effectively and efficiently manage these three stats of your character so they become less of a concern and you become able to focus on exploration; for the world of [Don't Starve: Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet") is a dangerous one, but it is also full of useful resources that will allow you to survive and thrive. This leads us to the very important mechanic of [crafting](/wiki/Crafting "Crafting"). Your left screen tab of crafting will allow you to build numerous tools and structures to help you move forward, so collecting the necessary resources and learning the recipes needed to prototype these items will also be a priority of yours when playing [Don't Starve: Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet"). ***So, basically,*** ***you will be exploring, collecting, crafting and, eventually, fighting your way through this game!***

### The world of Hamlet[]

Exotic, tropical and dangerous, the world of Hamlet is one full of jungles, ancient civilizations and treasures.

### Day one: A nice two-point landing[]

***DO: pick up the machete, gather your essentials (twigs, grass, flint, logs, food) and make it through the night.***

***DON'T: get into a fight.***

The [Maxameleon](/wiki/Maxameleon "Maxameleon") greeting [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") as he lands in the world of [Don't Starve: Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")

 

Welcome to your brand-new, unique Hamlet world. Each world map is randomly generated, but you will always spawn first hour of the day in the [Rainforest](/wiki/Rainforest "Rainforest") biome, in the first day of [temperate season,](/wiki/Seasons/Temperate "Seasons/Temperate") and surrounded by the remains of what seems to be a [crashed air balloon](/wiki/Crashed_Balloon "Crashed Balloon"). A [machete](/wiki/Machete "Machete") will be lying nearby. Pick it up. You'll need it.

You have now landed in a perilous tropical wild world full of hostile mobs and wonderful treasures.

Take a stroll around to get acquainted with the spot you've landed in and find out what's nearby and, as you do, make sure you pick [saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") for [twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs"), hack [tall grass](/wiki/Tall_Grass "Tall Grass") for [cut grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass") with your machete, and flip [stone slabs,](/wiki/Stone_Slab "Stone Slab") under which all kinds of useful resources can be found. Make sure you also pick up any [food](/wiki/Food "Food") you come across, such as [asparagus](/wiki/Asparagus "Asparagus") or [radishes](/wiki/Radish "Radish"). In the early game, [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") will be one of your main concerns. Darkness, come [nightime](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle"), will be another, for it is deadly without a [light](/wiki/Light_Tab "Light Tab") source. [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs") and [grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass") can be used to craft a basic [torch](/wiki/Torch "Torch"), but if you find [flint](/wiki/Flint "Flint"), you'll be able to craft an [axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe") which will allow you to chop down trees for [logs](/wiki/Log "Log") to create a [campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire"), which will also allow you to [cook](/wiki/Cooking "Cooking") any food you've gathered. There should be some [rainforest trees](/wiki/Rainforest_Tree "Rainforest Tree") near your spawning point; be careful when chopping them down, though, for they may drop food items such as [eggs](/wiki/Egg "Egg") when chopped down, but also [vipers](/wiki/Viper "Viper") or even [scorpions](/wiki/Scorpion "Scorpion") you'll need to fight or avoid.

If you craft a [hammer](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer"), you can destroy the remains of your crash for more useful items and tools, but if you don't, you can always come back later, for its location will show up on your [map](/wiki/Map "Map").

Remember, upon spawning you are very vulnerable and any aggressive [mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") will take you down due to your lack of [armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor") and decent [weapons](/wiki/Weapon "Weapon"). Gather your essentials, explore your surroundings and make it through the night.

### Day two: Pig City basics[]

***DO: locate Swinesbury and get acquainted with its grounds, locate the Slanty Shanty.***

***DON'T: steal from the pig farms.***

Wherever you spawn on day one, the [Cultivated](/wiki/Cultivated "Cultivated") biome, which surrounds the [Pig City](/wiki/Pig_City "Pig City"), will be nearby. This is one of the safest places in Hamlet's world, the home of a most peculiar civilization built by [Pigs](/wiki/Pig_Traders "Pig Traders"). In [Don't Starve: Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet") all pigs are friendly by default and, except for [guards](/wiki/Royal_Guard "Royal Guard"), harmless. Since resources within city limits are scarce or can only be obtained by trading, make sure you have everything you need to face hunger and darkness before going downtown.

#### The farmlands[]

When walking the cultivated grounds on your way to Pig City, you will come across [Watch Towers](/wiki/Watch_Tower "Watch Tower") and [Pig Guards](/wiki/Royal_Guard "Royal Guard"), meant to protect other pigs from aggressive mobs; [vegetable](/wiki/Vegetable "Vegetable") farms, [berry](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush") farms, grass farms, twig farms and [flower](/wiki/Flower "Flower") farms, where [Pig Farmers](/wiki/Pig_Traders/Farmer "Pig Traders/Farmer") work, and [boulders](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder"), where [Pig Miners](/wiki/Pig_Traders/Miner "Pig Traders/Miner") work. To summarize, a lot of otherwise scarce useful resources, all at hand's reach... Well no, not really, since if you take anything from the farms it will be considered stealing and you will be chased by the pig guard assigned to that specific farm. Unless wearing a [Swashy Hat](/wiki/Swashy_Hat "Swashy Hat"), harvesting pig farms is therefore not advised. Armed with a [halberd](/wiki/Halberd "Halberd"), pig guards are not to be underestimated, and they will remember you, coming after you again the next time you walk by their post. [Pig guards](/wiki/Royal_Guard "Royal Guard") will attack you if you do anything inappropriate within cultivated or city grounds, such as stealing, attacking a pig, or destroying a structure. Taking the loot dropped by a pig killed by a mob from the ground will also be considered stealing, so beware, especially within city grounds, where guards are difficult to avoid. Pig guards will also put out any fires built by the player, so take this into account when walking these biomes at night.

In addition to farms, [tea trees](/wiki/Tea_Tree "Tea Tree") can be found in the cultivated biome. These are a good source for logs, twigs and [seed pods](/wiki/Seed_Pod "Seed Pod"), and are often inhabited by [pikus](/wiki/Piko "Piko"), squirrel-like creatures who love to steal dropped items and provide one [morsel meat](/wiki/Morsel "Morsel") when killed. Since seed pods are also edible, chopping down tea trees is a good emergency way of obtaining food, especially if one places [traps](/wiki/Trap "Trap") near the trees, using [seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") as bait.

#### The suburbs[]

Also surrounding the Pig City you will find the [suburbs](/wiki/Suburbs "Suburbs"), a biome of variable size covered in [mossy turf](/wiki/Mossy_Turf "Mossy Turf"). Take your time to explore every inch of this small biome, for you will find an abundance of [twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs"), [grass](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft") and [rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks") here, and also [rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot").

#### The city: Swinesbury[]

This [Pig City](/wiki/Pig_City "Pig City") will most likely be your operations centre throughout the [Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet") game, and that's why we are visiting it on day two. You will find yourself in a beautiful town named Swinesbury, complete with pavement, [lamp posts](/wiki/Lamp_Post "Lamp Post"), ornamental gardens, [town houses](/wiki/Town_House "Town House") and [pig shops](/wiki/Pig_Shops "Pig Shops"). Mapping the entire town out will be extremely useful in your future, so walk every street as you marvel at the variety of [town inhabitants](/wiki/Pig_Traders "Pig Traders") you will find, each spawning from a town house. They roam the streets at daytime, when you can interact with them and exchange specific goods for [oincs](/wiki/Oinc "Oinc"), the local currency. You will use these oincs to purchase goods at the shops, which stay open until nighttime.

Somewhere in town, you will find a locked but uninhabited house called the [Slanty Shanty](/wiki/Slanty_Shanty "Slanty Shanty"). Congratulations, you're staring at your new home/basecamp. For now, you can pick the grass on the outside and chop down that creepy looking [Spiky Tree](/wiki/Spiky_Tree "Spiky Tree") for twigs.

### Day 3: A House and a Home[]

***DO: unlock the Slanty Shanty to set up base inside.***

***DON'T: forget to take care of your Hunger and other needs in the meantime.***

To thrive in [Don't Starve: Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet") we will need to set up a base camp, and the [Slanty Shanty](/wiki/Slanty_Shanty "Slanty Shanty") in Swinesbury is arguably the best place in the game to do so. To unlock it, you will need to exchange 50 oincs for a [Deed of home ownership](/wiki/Deed_of_home_ownership "Deed of home ownership") at the [Swinesbury City Hall](/wiki/Swinesbury_City_Hall "Swinesbury City Hall"). Inside it, you will be safe from attackers, weather inclemencies, and since it's equipped with a hanging lightbulb, darkness. As the game progresses you will need to build certain structures for crafting, food and survival, and if you build them inside the shanty, they will be safe, too. Only fire can harm this house, fire sparked, for example, from a [lightning strike](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning"); but if the [Slanty Shanty](/wiki/Slanty_Shanty "Slanty Shanty") burns down, [pig workers](/wiki/Pig_Traders/Worker "Pig Traders/Worker") from the city will rebuild it and every structure inside it. Lightning will never strike the shanty while you are inside it.

This will also be the right place for you to store your items for future purposes. [Seasons](/wiki/Seasons "Seasons") change and you will have different needs in different times and places of the game. So how do we get the 50 oincs we need to unlock the [Slanty Shanty](/wiki/Slanty_Shanty "Slanty Shanty")?

#### Trading of goods and oincs[]

As we mentioned before, in addition to [town houses](/wiki/Town_House "Town House"), one can find [shops](/wiki/Pig_Shops "Pig Shops") and other special buildings in [Swinesbury](/wiki/Pig_City "Pig City"), open during daytime and dusk.

In the early game, as you learn to properly manage your resources, remembering that food is sold in the city can be useful, as are the [tools](/wiki/Tools_Tab "Tools Tab") and [survival items](/wiki/Survival_Tab "Survival Tab") such as the [backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") you can purchase at the [general store](/wiki/Pigg_and_Pigglet%27s_General_Store "Pigg and Pigglet's General Store"). Actually, you might be running out of inventory space already. A [backpack](/wiki/Backpack "Backpack") may already be for sale at [Pigg and Pigglet's General Store](/wiki/Pigg_and_Pigglet%27s_General_Store "Pigg and Pigglet's General Store") for 5 oincs. [Pig shops](/wiki/Pig_Shops "Pig Shops") restock constantly and change the items available for buying often, so if they don't have what you need right now, visit again in a couple of days. But before going shopping, you will need [money](/wiki/Oinc "Oinc"), right?

You may have noticed that not every future neighbour of yours look the same. In Swinesbury there live [different pigs](/wiki/Pig_Traders "Pig Traders") with different needs. (See the article on [Pig Traders](/wiki/Pig_Traders "Pig Traders") for more information about the different pigs.) As you walk through town, they will tell you what they're after... In a more or less cryptic way. Since some of them ask for items that are very easy to obtain safely, such as [flower petals](/wiki/Petals "Petals"), trading these items with them for oincs is the easiest way to put together the 50 oincs you need for the [Deed of home ownership](/wiki/Deed_of_home_ownership "Deed of home ownership"):

| **[Florist](/wiki/Florist "Florist")** | Florist Florist | Petals | **1x**  Oinc | Once per day | * Pick [petals](/wiki/Petals "Petals") from [exotic flowers](/wiki/Flower "Flower") in nearby biomes. |

| **[Farmer](/wiki/Farmer "Farmer")** | Farmer Farmer | Cut GrassTwigs | **1x**  Oinc | Once per day | * Pick [grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass") and [twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs") from nearby biomes * Remember these can also be found in the [surrounding city suburbs](/wiki/Suburbs "Suburbs") |

| **[Usher](/wiki/Usher "Usher")** | Usher Usher | HoneyFist Full of JamIce CreamPumpkin CookieWafflesBerriesRoasted Berries | **4x**  Oinc | Once per day | * Buy [berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries") at the [Swinesbury Fine Grocer's](/wiki/Swinesbury_Fine_Grocer%27s "Swinesbury Fine Grocer's") for 1 oinc/piece * Then sell them to these guys for 4 oincs/piece * Buying [berry bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush") from [Miss Sow's Floral Arrangements](/wiki/Miss_Sow%27s_Floral_Arrangements "Miss Sow's Floral Arrangements") and planting them around the [Slanty Shanty](/wiki/Slanty_Shanty "Slanty Shanty") is also a good idea to prepare for the future. Berries take time to grow, but once they do, they'll belong to you. |

Mind that some of these pigs can also be found inside buildings as shopkeepers and you can trade with them, too, so come [dusk](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle") time, you can visit each [shop](/wiki/Pig_Shops "Pig Shops") to gather those additional oincs, since everybody has gone home but shops remain open 'til night. This is also a good time to check you have everything you need to make it through nightime. Do not forget that you still need to eat, to keep safe from aggresive [mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") and a source of [light](/wiki/Light_Tab "Light Tab") to make it through [nightime](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle") as you gather the 50 oincs to enter the safety of the [Slanty Shanty](/wiki/Slanty_Shanty "Slanty Shanty"). It shouldn't take you more than a couple days to put the money together.

A good strategy is to spend a day traveling to nearby biomes to gather [twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs"), [grass](/wiki/Cut_Grass "Cut Grass"), [stones](/wiki/Stone "Stone") and [flower petals](/wiki/Petals "Petals"); as you do so, also gather [logs](/wiki/Log "Log"), [flint](/wiki/Flint "Flint") and [food](/wiki/Food "Food") such as [asparagus](/wiki/Asparagus "Asparagus"), [radishes](/wiki/Radish "Radish"), [aloe](/wiki/Aloe "Aloe") and [seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") for your own survival. Hunting [Peagawks](/wiki/Peagawk "Peagawk") for [feathers](/wiki/Feather "Feather") will also keep you well fed, and if you walk the edges of a [Deep Rainforest](/wiki/Deep_Rainforest "Deep Rainforest") biome you may even spot a [lost relic](/wiki/Lost_Relics "Lost Relics") you can pick up safely without really entering the jungle and trade later for ten oincs at the [Swinesbury Academy](/wiki/Swinesbury_Academy "Swinesbury Academy"). Once you've gathered enough items, initiate your return to [Swinesbury](/wiki/Pig_City "Pig City"). Come nightime, camp near the city but outside the biome so [pig guards](/wiki/Royal_Guard "Royal Guard") don't put out your fire. Choose a safe spot, cook your gathered food in a [campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") and head downtown in the morning to trade with the pigs on the streets. As you walk the streets, shave any grown [hedges](/wiki/Hedge "Hedge") you come across for [clippings](/wiki/Clippings "Clippings") to trade, and pick up any [manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure") you find laying around. Each time you pick manure from the ground in town and you are seen by a neighbour, you will be given 1 oinc, so don't pick up [seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds") from the town's grounds - pigs eat them and then produce manure - and don't pick manure in town at [dusk or night time](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle"), for you will not be seen and therefore not rewarded. Don't worry, it will still be there in the morning for you to pick up. Keep in mind that if you drop any edible items on the town's grounds, the pigs will eat them, too.

Last but not least, beware of the [Masked Pig](/wiki/Masked_Pig "Masked Pig"). These sneak up on you and steal your oincs, making all your progress in saving for the [Deed of home ownership](/wiki/Deed_of_home_ownership "Deed of home ownership") lost!
