**Wilson's Field Notes** are a series of blog posts written by Kevin on the (now-defunct) *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* webpage. They detail some of [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")'s survival experiences, and were posted from June to July 2012. Due to the various changes the *Don't Starve* franchise has been through since, it's unknown if Wilson's Field Notes are canonical.

*I am a scientist, not a labourer! I’m used to probing the depths of the universe with the power of my mind, not digging holes and chopping down trees. But I’m also used to having walls and a roof, so I suppose one must make allowances for circumstance.*

*I should be able to put together some simple tools using the twigs and flint that litter the ground here. I may be reduced to living off the sweat of my brow, but at least I don’t have to do so with my bare hands.*

## Beefalo[]

*I stumbled across a herd of these brutes today while I was hunting rabbits. When one noticed me I was certain that I was a goner, but it soon lost interest and resumed eating.*

*The Beefalo spend almost all of their time eating. What little time they don’t spend eating they spend performing the **other** aspect of the digestive process. The stench of a Beefalo herd cannot be described with polite language, although the dung is quite useful in small quantities.*

*I’m tired of eating rabbits. Tonight I shall try hunting a Beefalo instead. Their docile nature should make them an excellent food source...*

## Meat Effigy[]

*I am in an environment much harsher than that to which I am accustomed. Everything here is trying to kill me, or eat me, or... worse. It’s almost as bad as graduate school!*

*If I am to survive this place, I fear I must resort to drastic measures. That’s okay, though, for I am a Scientist, and my Science is nothing if not drastic. I think that if I build a wooden effigy of myself, and fill it full of meat, I can create an insurance policy against violent death. It’s a technique that’s well-known amongst the scientific community.*

*Maybe I should throw in some of my beard hairs as well. It couldn’t hurt!*
