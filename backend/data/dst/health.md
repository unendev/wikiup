**“**For documenting my pain.**”**

–[Wendy](/wiki/Wendy "Wendy")

**Health** is a measurement of overall physical well-being. Unlike [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") (and in many situations [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity")), Health typically does not drain over time. Health is lost instantly when a character is hit by an enemy attack, eats harmful food such as [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") and [Rot](/wiki/Rot "Rot"), or harvests from thorny plants like the [Spiky Bush](/wiki/Spiky_Bush "Spiky Bush"). In *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* (RoG), Health is lost instantly when harvesting from [Cacti](/wiki/Cactus "Cactus"). Health is lost continually while the character is [burning](/wiki/Fire "Fire"), [starving](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"), or [freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing"). In RoG, characters also lose Health while [overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") and in *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* (SW), while [poisoned](/wiki/Poison "Poison"). Losing all Health results in [death](/wiki/Death "Death") (although not necessarily the loss of the game). Health can be seen on the heart-shaped gauge in the upper-right corner of the screen, which shrivels and empties as the character's Health is depleted. Note that having a [Meat Effigy](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy") lowers max Health. [Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda") in DST does not have a health meter, instead, she has an age meter.

\*Wolfgang has 200 Health by default (his Health limit rises to 300 with a full belly and drops to 150 when starving). This is not true for *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* as his health cap is only 200.

\*\*WX-78 begins with 100 Health and is capable of increasing their Health Cap up to 400 by eating [Gears](/wiki/Gears "Gears").  
\*\*WX-78 begins 125 Health in *Don't Starve Together* and is capable of increasing their Health Cap by using [Hardy Circuit](/wiki/Hardy_Circuit "Hardy Circuit") and [Super-Hardy Circuits](/wiki/Super-Hardy_Circuit "Super-Hardy Circuit").

\*\*\*Wilba's werepig form has 350 health.

\*\*\*\*Wurt has 250 health when [King of the Merms](/wiki/King_of_the_Merms "King of the Merms") is alive.

## Healing[]

Health can be restored in a few ways. The most basic way to regain health is by eating [Food](/wiki/Food "Food"), most of which typically provides 1-3 health when consumed. [Cooking](/wiki/Cooking "Cooking") the food often increases the Health 1 or 2 points. There are also a few items whose sole purpose is to heal.

Wormwood is unable to gain health from eating food and must rely on other methods to restore it.

Certain food and items provide a greater health boost and are thus very valuable:

* [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot"): Several Crock Pot recipes provide substantial healing. [Mandrake Soup](/wiki/Mandrake_Soup "Mandrake Soup") is a powerful and flexible healing recipe [+100 Health]. [Fishsticks](/wiki/Fishsticks "Fishsticks") [+40 Health] are an easy recipe to make. [Pierogi](/wiki/Pierogi "Pierogi") [+40 Health] is also a good recipe. [Dragonpie](/wiki/Dragonpie "Dragonpie") [+40 Health] is excellent if the player manages to create a [Dragon Fruit](/wiki/Dragon_Fruit "Dragon Fruit") farm. In SW, [Bisque](/wiki/Bisque "Bisque") [+60 Health] is food that can be easily produced, and is one of the most potent healing items in the game. However, regarding Crock Pot recipes in general, the player must make sure that the individual components (raw or cooked) won't heal more if eaten on their own.

* [Braised Eggplant](/wiki/Braised_Eggplant "Braised Eggplant")/[Sliced Pomegranate](/wiki/Sliced_Pomegranate "Sliced Pomegranate"): When cooked, [Eggplants](/wiki/Eggplant "Eggplant") and [Pomegranates](/wiki/Pomegranate "Pomegranate") heal 20 Health.

* [Jerky](/wiki/Jerky "Jerky")/[Small Jerky](/wiki/Small_Jerky "Small Jerky"): Jerky and Small Jerky restore 20 Health and 8 Health respectively and last for a very long time. If primary concern is health, and the player's only food source is [Meats](/wiki/Meats "Meats"), they should be made into jerky. Jerky can be used in a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") as normal meat, if needed.

* [Spider Gland](/wiki/Spider_Gland "Spider Gland")/[Mosquito Sack](/wiki/Mosquito_Sack "Mosquito Sack"): [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders") drop Spider Glands that can be used immediately for restoring 8 Health. In a similar way, [Mosquitoes](/wiki/Mosquito "Mosquito") drop their sacks which heal the same amount of health as Spider Glands. Neither item spoils, however, this isn't practical to stockpile them due to the relatively small amount of health restored when using them.

* [Healing Salve](/wiki/Healing_Salve "Healing Salve"): Spider Glands can also be made into Healing Salves that restore 20 Health each. Healing Salves do not spoil.

* [Yellow Mosquito Sack](/wiki/Yellow_Mosquito_Sack "Yellow Mosquito Sack")Don't Starve: Shipwrecked: [Poison Mosquitos](/wiki/Poison_Mosquito "Poison Mosquito") in SW occasionally drop Yellow Mosquito Sacks, which restore 20 Health when used. Like regular Mosquito Sacks, they do not spoil.

* [Bee Boxes](/wiki/Bee_Box "Bee Box"): Bee Boxes produce [Honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey") which by itself restores 3 Health. If the player has access to [Reeds](/wiki/Reeds "Reeds"), Honey can be used to create [Honey Poultices](/wiki/Honey_Poultice "Honey Poultice"), which restore 30 Health when used. Honey also is used in a number of Crock Pot dishes which restore varying amounts of health. Honey Poultices do not spoil, despite Honey spoiling in-game.

* [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterfly "Butterfly"): Butterflies drop [Butterfly Wings](/wiki/Butterfly_Wings "Butterfly Wings"), which restore 8 Health. Also, Butterflies have a 2% chance to drop [Butter](/wiki/Butter "Butter"), which restores 40 Health on its own. Additionally, the wings can be easily used to make a [Butter Muffin](/wiki/Butter_Muffin "Butter Muffin"), which restores 20 Health, while also filling some hunger. The Butter can be used to cook [Waffles](/wiki/Waffles "Waffles"), which restores 60 Health and is one of the most potent healing items in the game. Butterfly farms can be created easily and synergize well with Bee Boxes.

* [Blue Mushroom](/wiki/Blue_Mushroom "Blue Mushroom"): Eating a raw [Blue Cap](/wiki/Blue_Mushroom "Blue Mushroom") restores 20 Health, although at the cost of -15 Sanity. Blue mushrooms can only be picked at [night](/wiki/Night "Night") and can't be relocated, so large scale farming is usually impractical. Still, they provide a nice boost for players who build their base near them, or when the player is exploring away from their base.

* [Life Giving Amulet](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet"): Wearing a Life Giving Amulet will automatically heal the player by +5 Health in exchange for 5 Hunger and 5% of its durability. If the player dies while wearing it, it will also automatically [resurrect](/wiki/Resurrection "Resurrection") the player with 50 of Health, however when used this way, it will be immediately destroyed.

## Maximum health[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/c5/Health lowered.png/revision/latest?cb=20130219142324 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/c5/Health lowered.png/revision/latest?cb=20130219142324 

Health lowered from +120 to +90 by [Meat Effigies](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy")

 

Aside from the current health, the character's maximum health can also change under specific conditions. When the maximum health is decreased, it will be shown as a black bar on the health meter.

* [Meat Effigy](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy"): If the player builds a Meat Effigy, then their maximum health is decreased by 30 for each effigy built. This health is impossible to regain unless the Meat Effigy is destroyed or used. In Don't Starve Together, the player does not lose maximum health.
* [Telltale Heart](/wiki/Telltale_Heart "Telltale Heart"), [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern")Don't Starve Together: Resurrecting via Telltale Heart or Florid Postern in DST will reduce the maximum health by 25% of the player's maximum health.
* [Booster Shot](/wiki/Booster_Shot "Booster Shot")Don't Starve Together: The Booster Shot is only available in DST, and when used, restores 25% of the lost maximum health.

Some characters have special abilities that change their maximum health. When the maximum health is changed due to these abilities, the black bars won't be shown.

* Special ability of [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang"): Wolfgang's max health value changes according to his hunger.
* Special ability of [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78"): They can consume [Gears](/wiki/Gears "Gears") to raise the cap of 3 stats, including Health.

## Touch Stone[]

If the player comes across a [Touch Stone](/wiki/Touch_Stone "Touch Stone") in the world and activates it, they may respawn there as well. To identify one, there are 4 [Pig Heads](/wiki/Pig_Heads "Pig Heads") around it and [Wooden Flooring](/wiki/Wooden_Flooring "Wooden Flooring") underneath.

There may be more than one Touch Stone in the world, but the player will respawn at the one closest to their death point. Touch Stones may only be used once and drop [Marble](/wiki/Marble "Marble"), [Rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks"), and [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") upon doing so.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The player can have 0 points of Health and not die. However, letting their Health go below 0 will kill them. This is due to points of health is a decimal.
