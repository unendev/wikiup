**“**It's dripping all over.**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell")

The **Marsh**, commonly referred to as the **Swamp**, is one of the [Biomes](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes") in the game and the place where [Marsh Turfs](/wiki/Marsh_Turf "Marsh Turf") are abundant.

The Marsh is considered the most dangerous and inhospitable of all [Biomes](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes") for its native [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle"), which attack without provocation, and [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm") which, while only hostile at close proximity, present a danger when camping in or near Marsh areas. [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") appear frequently in the Marsh, which normally leads to confrontation with other [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs"). As a result, players can take away lots of loot after their wars end. This can also make it possible for a [player](/wiki/Characters "Characters") to camp in a Marsh if they are prepared and brave enough, though it's not easy: see the [Marsh Camp Guide](/wiki/Guides/Marsh_Camp_Guide "Guides/Marsh Camp Guide") for more tips on how a [player](/wiki/Characters "Characters") can survive this harsh [Biome](/wiki/Biomes "Biomes"). However [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt") can safely settle in the Marsh without having to worry.

It is recommended to keep moving and stay on the roads to avoid being attacked by the Marsh's hostile inhabitants. [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle") cannot spawn on roads, which makes them useful when moving around. A [player](/wiki/Characters "Characters") can find [Reeds](/wiki/Reeds "Reeds") randomly scattered across the area, which can also rarely spawn outside of the Marsh [Biome](/wiki/Biome "Biome").

Marshes are also the only biome where [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle"), [Spiky Trees](/wiki/Tree#Spiky_Tree "Tree"), and [Spiky Bushes](/wiki/Spiky_Bush "Spiky Bush") exist in the base game. In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, [Spiky Trees](/wiki/Tree#Spiky_Tree "Tree") and [Spiky Bushes](/wiki/Spiky_Bush "Spiky Bush") can also be found in the [Desert](/wiki/Desert "Desert") [Biome](/wiki/Biome "Biome"). [Mermhouses](/wiki/Mermhouse "Mermhouse") also appear in marshes. While they can also be found outside of a marsh, this is very rare.

This type of marsh is found in [Caves](/wiki/Cave "Cave"). It includes all the things a normal marsh has except for [Mermhouses](/wiki/Mermhouse "Mermhouse"). It is rich in [Reeds](/wiki/Reeds "Reeds") and a player can harvest an average of fifty [Cut Reeds](/wiki/Cut_Reeds "Cut Reeds") in the whole area. However, this biome is also infested with [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle") and at least five tier-three [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den"). Therefore, players should take extreme caution when venturing into this area.

In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* DLC, a different variant of Marsh Biome can be found, called **Tidal Marsh**. Tidal Marshes are entirely covered with [Tidal Marsh Turf](/wiki/Tidal_Marsh_Turf "Tidal Marsh Turf"). This biome contains [Reeds](/wiki/Reeds "Reeds") and [Green Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms#Green_Mushrooms "Mushrooms") similar to the original Marsh, as well as [Tidal Pools](/wiki/Tidal_Pool "Tidal Pool") replacing [Ponds](/wiki/Pond "Pond"), and [Flups](/wiki/Flup "Flup") replacing [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle"). Additionally [Fishermerm's Huts](/wiki/Fishermerm%27s_Hut "Fishermerm's Hut") and [Poisonous Holes](/wiki/Poisonous_Hole "Poisonous Hole") can often be found in this biome. Unlike [Tentacles](/wiki/Tentacle "Tentacle"), [Flups](/wiki/Flup "Flup") are renewable, and over time new [Flups](/wiki/Flup "Flup") will spawn in [Tidal Marsh Turf](/wiki/Tidal_Marsh_Turf "Tidal Marsh Turf") tiles around the Marsh.
