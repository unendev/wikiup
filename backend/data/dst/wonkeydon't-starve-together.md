`"wonkey"`

Wonkey, similar to [Wilbur](/wiki/Wilbur "Wilbur") from *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")*, has the ability to run after walking continuously for 3 seconds. While running its base speed is increased to 8 (the average value for most characters is 6), which is 33% faster than normal.

Wonkey has permanent right of passage on the Moon Quay island, and will not be harassed by the Powder Monkeys on the island.

[Prime Mates](/wiki/Prime_Mate "Prime Mate") will not attack Wonkey when it steps on their boat.

The curse can be removed by giving Bananas to the Queen of Moon Quay, who will remove 4 Accursed Trinkets from the player's inventory for each Banana. Wonkey will transform back into the original character when the player has 0 Accursed Trinkets, but will still have right of passage on the Moon Quay for half a day as a result of giving Bananas to the Queen.

The Curse can be removed by death, dropping all trinkets in the process, so one should keep that in mind when attempting to retrieve the items that were dropped.

## Disadvantage[]

As Wonkey, [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig") and [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") will become hostile; [Catcoons](/wiki/Catcoon "Catcoon"), however, will not.

Although the player can now understand Powder Monkeys and the Queen of Moon Quay, dialogue from other mobs such as Pigs, Rabbitmen, the [Crabby Hermit](/wiki/Crabby_Hermit "Crabby Hermit"), and even the [Ancient Fuelweaver](/wiki/Reanimated_Skeleton#Ancient_Fuelweaver "Reanimated Skeleton") will turn into incomprehensible gibberish.

Although Wonkey has greater speed while running, its base speed is slower, with a penalty of -0.5 (5.5 total speed without additional modifiers, which is about 8.3% slower than normal). This presents a disadvantage when frequent stops are made while moving, since 3 seconds of movement are required before starting to run. While running, hunger drains 33% faster than normal. Even so, it does arrive at its destination 33% sooner than a normal character, covering the same ground for the same hunger cost.

If a player was playing as [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes") before the transformation, they would still not be able to talk.

## Prototype Tips[]

* Despite being a curse and lacking in unique perks, Wonkey will also remove the downsides of the player's original character, allowing multiple interactions that would otherwise be impossible:
  + Wigfrid will be able to eat non-Meat food
  + Wurt will be able to eat Meat food and trade with the Pig King (although ordinary pigs will remain hostile)
  + Wormwood and Wanda can heal normally
  + Warly And Wortox can eat all foods without penalty
  + Wandaâ€™s age will be converted into health, at a 0.4 age to 1 health conversion rate, and vice versa when transforming back
  + Wickerbottom can sleep allowing her to get gifts at the Winter Feast Tree
