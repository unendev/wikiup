The **Forging Hammer** is an melee [Weapon](/wiki/Weapon "Weapon") [Item](/wiki/Item "Item") exclusive to [The Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge") event in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. It is available immediately from strength-based characters such as [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang"), [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78"), and [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona").

During the normal hammer attack, a [Character](/wiki/Character "Character") deals 20 [Damage](/wiki/Damage "Damage") to the target. At the same time, an attacked target has a broken shield icon above their head - a sign that their defense has been broken, and 5-10% more damage is dealt to them. Basic attacks deal physical damage.

The special ability of the Forging Hammer is the Anvil Strike. When used, it creates a small field where the character jumps, dealing 30 electrical damage to all enemies in an area and provoking them to attack the offender. Also, the enemies are in a stationary state for some time after the impact, playing the animation of receiving an electric shock and not reacting to anything. Thus, during this time, they cannot attack and move for one second. This ability is capable of causing [Snortoises](/wiki/Snortoise "Snortoise") and [Boarillas](/wiki/Boarilla "Boarilla") to come out of the shield.

## Tips[]

* The ability to break through enemy armor is very important in The Forge. Players without a hammer are advised to focus on the target that the player with the hammer is attacking. But the player with the hammer should also attack those whom the rest of the team has already chosen to attack.
* When fighting Snortoises and Boarillas, it's best to save the primary ability to break through their block. It is better to cooperate with the rest of the team, in what order who will do it, so as to not spend 2 main abilities at once.
* Since performing the Anvil Strike deals electrical damage, WX-78 will deal double the damage of 60 with this ability.
