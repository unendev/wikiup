**Seasons** are different times of the *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* year in which the environment changes, changing the gameplay. Note that while seasons have specific lengths specified in the code, there appears to be relatively common rounding errors that result in one extra day being in a season; this tends to add 1-2 days per year. In Don't Starve Together, these extra days are much less common.

In [Sandbox Mode](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode"), if you don't customize your world, the first [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter") will begin on day 21 and end on day 35 (15 days total). The seasons should then keep alternating between 20 day Summers and 15 day Winters (next winter on day 56, etc.).

For customization:

* A long season lasts around 50 days
* A short season lasts around 10 days

During [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer"), the [days](/wiki/Day-Night_Cycle "Day-Night Cycle") are longer, crops grow, and [Food](/wiki/Food "Food") is easier to find.

In Winter, [Nights](/wiki/Night "Night") are longer and the player must stay warm to avoid [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") to death. Plants stop growing and many creatures stop being active, while other creatures can only be encountered during Winter.

Winter can be a challenge and should not be taken lightly. Players should prepare for Winter during the Summer by stocking up on resources and making sure they will have sources of heat, Food, and [Health](/wiki/Health "Health"), as well as the means to defend themselves from [Monsters](/wiki/Monsters "Monsters").

## https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f8/Reign of Giants icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20140408110712 Reign of Giants[]

In the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC as well as *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, there are four seasons; [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"), Summer, [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn"), and Winter. Winter is largely the same, albeit with changes to [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops") that make survival more difficult. Autumn, for the most part, is the old Summer, making it the safest season of the year. A new Summer has been added, in which the player is susceptible to [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") (the opposite of "Freezing" in the Winter). During Spring, there is no Freezing or Overheating, but [rainfall](/wiki/Rain "Rain") is excessive and can cause [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness"), which causes rapid [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") loss, and can lead to Freezing after prolonged exposure. [Rabbit](/wiki/Rabbit "Rabbit") holes will close, forcing the player to switch food sources in the Spring, [Bees](/wiki/Bees "Bees") will turn [red](/wiki/Killer_Bees "Killer Bees") (hostile) and [Beefalos](/wiki/Beefalos "Beefalos") will be in heat, making them hostile to everything.

Spring and Autumn are considered "friendly" seasons, while Summer and Winter are considered "harsh". Because of this, when starting a new game, the default starting season will be either Spring or Autumn. The "friendly" seasons last for 20 days each, whereas the "harsh" seasons are only 15 days. A full year in the game is 70 days long.

Season Length Settings (Days)

|  | Very Short | Short | Default | Long | Very Long |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring") | 5 | 12 | 20 | 30 | 50 |
| [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") | 5 | 10 | 15 | 22 | 40 |
| [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn") | 5 | 12 | 20 | 30 | 50 |
| [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter") | 5 | 10 | 15 | 22 | 40 |

Each season now has its own "Giant", or boss mob, that spawns sometime during the respective season. Winter retains the [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops"), but now there is the [Bearger](/wiki/Bearger "Bearger") in Autumn, the [Antlion](/wiki/Antlion "Antlion")(DST)/[Dragonfly](/wiki/Dragonfly "Dragonfly")(RoG) in Summer, and the [Moose/Goose](/wiki/Moose/Goose "Moose/Goose") in Spring. Each giant will drop a material needed to craft an item that can be used to better survive the hazards of the following season, with the exception of the Dragonfly, as being before Autumn (the season with no special hazard), will instead drop a material to craft an item used for combat or a special container.

## https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/46/Shipwrecked icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20151205104708 Shipwrecked[]

In the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC, there are four seasons; [Mild Season](/wiki/Mild_Season "Mild Season") (20 days), [Hurricane Season](/wiki/Hurricane_Season "Hurricane Season") (16 days), [Monsoon Season](/wiki/Monsoon_Season "Monsoon Season") (20 days), and [Dry Season](/wiki/Dry_Season "Dry Season") (16 days). Compared to Reign of Giants, the year is slightly longer, at 72 days, as half the seasons have an extra day.

Mild Season is equivalent to autumn without hazards apart from occasional strong winds and mild rain. Hurricane Season differs the most from seasons in Reign of Giants where instead of having to deal with cold, the hazards are frequent strong winds, downpour, lightning and large waves. Monsoon Season is similar to spring with frequent rains but with additional hazard of areas getting flooded. Dry season is equivalent to Reign of Giants' summer with overheating but with the added danger of volcanoes erupting.

## Hamlet icon Hamlet[]

In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")* DLC, there are three seasons; [Temperate Season](/wiki/Temperate_Season "Temperate Season"), [Humid Season](/wiki/Humid_Season "Humid Season"), and [Lush Season](/wiki/Lush_Season "Lush Season"). Each season lasts for 11 days, making Hamlet's year the shortest at 33 days. The Temperate Season is the equivalent of [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn"), with no special hazards, other than short rain showers and thunderstorms. The Humid Season is similar to [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"), including lots of rain and thunderstorms in addition to [Fog](/wiki/Fog "Fog"), a new hazard which reduces the player's vision range to a small radius around the character, much like [Sandstorms](/wiki/Sandstorm "Sandstorm"), and slows them down if they are wearing anything in the Chest or Head slot. The Lush season does not seem to resemble any other season in the game. During this season, the major hazards are [Hay Fever](/wiki/Hay_Fever "Hay Fever"), which causes the player to sneeze periodically, losing 3Sanity per sneeze and dropping 0-4 items from the inventory; as well as [Brambles](/wiki/Bramble "Bramble"), which randomly block off some areas of the world.

Modifying season length works the same way as Autumn in Reign of Giants; 5, 12, 30, and 50 days for very short, short, long, and very long respectively. This oddly means that a choosing to make any Hamlet season short will actually increase its length from 11 days to 12.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* In the Reign of Giants DLC, If the player tries to disable all the seasons the game shows a custom error message.
* If the player disables a season such as winter, and then tries to generate a world starting with the season that is disabled, the characteristics of the season such as snow in winter will generate in the first 1-10 seconds before quickly disappearing.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a9/Autumn RoG poster.png/revision/latest?cb=20140122232925 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a9/Autumn RoG poster.png/revision/latest?cb=20140122232925 

Autumn depicted in a promotional image for *Reign of Giants*.

 

**Autumn** is one of the four **seasons** from the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC. It has a 50% chance to be the starting season instead of [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"). Autumn is mostly a peaceful season, comparable to [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") in the vanilla version of the game.

Autumn lasts 20 days by default, so the first Autumn lasts either from day 1 to 20, or from day 37 to 56. This will change if the length of the seasons is edited in the [Preferences](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode#Sandbox_.28Custom.29 "Sandbox Mode"). Stages in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") may have different seasonal variations.

During the majority of autumn, nights are short. This allows moving around more often without fearing the dark. It also means that less supplies are needed to survive the darkness.

During Autumn, the player does not have to worry about [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") or [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing"), there is only occasionally [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain"), [Farm Crops](/wiki/Crops "Crops") grow normally, [Walrus Camps](/wiki/Walrus_Camp "Walrus Camp") are not active, [Red Hounds](/wiki/Red_Hound "Red Hound") may occasionally appear rather than [Normal Hounds](/wiki/Hound "Hound") during timed Hound attacks, [Redbirds and Crows](/wiki/Birds "Birds") appear, and the [Koalefant](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant") appears with a red hide. Also, [Birchnut Trees](/wiki/Birchnut_Tree "Birchnut Tree") will start to lose their leaves, which change color, and fully-grown ones will yield extra [Birchnuts](/wiki/Birchnut "Birchnut") when cut down. However, in Don't Starve Together, they have the highest chance of spawning [Poison Birchnut Trees](/wiki/Tree/Birchnut#Poison_Birchnut_Tree "Tree/Birchnut"). Any resource such as [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling"), or [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush") that withered in the Summer will return to their harvested state at the beginning of Autumn. [Mini Glaciers](/wiki/Mini_Glacier "Mini Glacier") begin to form during autumn.

Autumn's seasonal [Giant](/wiki/Giant "Giant") is the [Bearger](/wiki/Bearger "Bearger"). It will eat [Food](/wiki/Food "Food") off the ground and destroy any [Structures](/wiki/Structures "Structures") and [Plants](/wiki/Plants "Plants") that get in its way when it is rampaging.

Autumn leads to [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), so players might want to spend their first Autumn preparing for the harsh weather that will soon be upon them.

Winter depicted in a promotional image for *Reign of Giants*.

 

**“**Life in the frozen wastes.**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

**Winter** is one of two [seasons](/wiki/Season "Season") affecting the surface present in *Don't Starve* (the other being [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer")). It is also one of the four seasons in *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, the others being Summer, [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"), and [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn"). By default, [Sandbox Mode](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode "Sandbox Mode") Winter lasts for 16 days; the first winter will start on day 21 and lasts until day 36, with the next spring starting on day 37. This will change if the player edits the length of the seasons in the [Preferences](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode#Sandbox_(Custom) "Sandbox Mode"). Stages in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") may have different seasonal variations. Many things in the world change in Winter and surviving can become much more difficult.

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together"),* Winter lasts for 15 days, the first winter will start on day 21 and lasts until the end of day 35.

## Freezing[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing")*

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/65/Winter.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130405032000

The biggest change in Winter is the drop in temperature, which results in freezing if the player's [character](/wiki/Characters "Characters") gets too cold. Freezing quickly drops the player's health. To prevent freezing, characters must maintain their body temperature by regularly going back to a source of heat. The best way to do that is to carry around a heated [Thermal Stone](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone"), and one should always have the means to make [Fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire") in an emergency during winter. Additionally, wearing [warm clothing](/wiki/Freezing#Warm_Clothing "Freezing") increases the time a character can be away from fire before getting too cold. [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") and [Webber](/wiki/Webber "Webber")'s [Beards](/wiki/Beard "Beard") also help them keep warm, acting similar to warm clothing, and their efficiency increases as it gets longer.

Building a [Thermal Measurer](/wiki/Thermal_Measurer "Thermal Measurer") helps the player know when the change in seasons is coming ahead of time, and tells how cold it is getting. [Dusk](/wiki/Dusk "Dusk") and [Night](/wiki/Night "Night") are colder than [Day](/wiki/Day "Day"), and they last longer in Winter. Freezing is often a recurring death for new players as they don't prepare well enough to stop freezing in an emergency. A good strategy to keep temperature up is to put on warm clothes on the last day of Summer (or Autumn in the *Reign of Giants* DLC) so heat will start off higher in winter.

## Seasonal Changes[]

* During Winter, several new creatures appear and some others go into hiding. The change which can be seen on the first day of Winter (even before snow begins to fall) is that the sepia toned environment gets a bluish tint.
* [Redbirds](/wiki/Redbirds "Redbirds") are replaced by [Snowbirds](/wiki/Snowbirds "Snowbirds").
* [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbits "Rabbits") change into a white winter coat, and remain both an active and stable food source throughout the Winter season.
* When [Hounds](/wiki/Hounds "Hounds") attack, [Red Hounds](/wiki/Red_Hounds "Red Hounds") are replaced with [Blue Hounds](/wiki/Blue_Hounds "Blue Hounds"), which will freeze nearby mobs upon death with an [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff")-like effect.
* Going on a [Koalefant](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant") hunt will result in finding a [Winter Koalefant](/wiki/Winter_Koalefant "Winter Koalefant"), whose [trunk](/wiki/Winter_Koalefant_Trunk "Winter Koalefant Trunk") can be made into a warm [Puffy Vest](/wiki/Puffy_Vest "Puffy Vest").

* Some new aggressive creatures appear as well.
  + A [Walrus hunting party](/wiki/Mactusk_N%27_Son "Mactusk N' Son") led by [MacTusk](/wiki/MacTusk "MacTusk"), along with his son [WeeTusk](/wiki/WeeTusk "WeeTusk") and their 2 [Blue Hounds](/wiki/Blue_Hounds "Blue Hounds"), will appear in an igloo at their [Walrus Camp](/wiki/Walrus_Camp "Walrus Camp"), which can be found (albeit abandoned) during Summer.
  + [Deerclops](/wiki/Deerclops "Deerclops") roams the Winter landscape. Deerclops is huge but slow, and will target any and all nearby [structures](/wiki/Structures "Structures") upon spawning before moving on to attacking the player themselves.
* A new type of neutral creature, known as [Pengulls](/wiki/Pengulls "Pengulls"), will often hop out of the ocean in huge flocks during winter, gathering in large nesting grounds with several [Mini Glaciers](/wiki/Mini_Glacier "Mini Glacier") (making the latter renewable for the season). They will occasionally lay [Eggs](/wiki/Egg "Egg") and hide them, only dropping them on death or if they happen to spoil. Attacking a pengull will cause all pengulls within a large radius to become aggressive and swarm the attacker, which can quickly lead to the player’s untimely demise.

* Many creatures are inactive in Winter.
  + [Bees](/wiki/Bees "Bees") will never leave their [hives](/wiki/Beehive "Beehive"), and thus don't produce [honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey") ([Killer Bees](/wiki/Killer_Bees "Killer Bees") and homeless bees can still be found).
  + [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterflies "Butterflies") don't spawn from [flowers](/wiki/Flowers "Flowers").
  + [Mosquitoes](/wiki/Mosquitoes "Mosquitoes") or [Frogs](/wiki/Frogs "Frogs") don't spawn because [Ponds](/wiki/Ponds "Ponds") themselves are frozen over and cannot be fished, although they can be walked across.
  + [Batilisks](/wiki/Batilisk "Batilisk") will [spawn](/wiki/Sinkhole "Sinkhole") in fewer numbers, but stay out longer.

* In addition to [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain"), snow begins to fall during Winter, which builds up on [trees](/wiki/Trees "Trees") and many other objects (this snow melts away during Summer or Winter rain).
* For the majority of the season, the temperature is too low for [Farms](/wiki/Farms "Farms") to grow crops, however any crops currently awaiting harvest will still be fresh until picked.
* [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bushes "Berry Bushes"), [Saplings](/wiki/Saplings "Saplings"), [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tufts "Grass Tufts"), [Reeds](/wiki/Reeds "Reeds") and [Cave Lichen](/wiki/Cave_Lichen "Cave Lichen") regrow extremely slowly in Winter, to the point that they seem to stop completely. [Spiky Bushes](/wiki/Spiky_Bush "Spiky Bush") and [Light Flowers](/wiki/Light_Flower "Light Flower") are not affected by the winter cold and will regrow as in Summer.

* Nights and Dusks are much longer in winter, and this has a subtle impact on [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity"). Sanity slowly drains at dusk & night, and does not have a chance to fully recharge during the winter day. This is compounded as sanity falls, because night-time hallucinations (and nearness to dark) further drain sanity—spiralling into more impactful hallucinations, including [Night Hands](/wiki/Night_Hand "Night Hand"). A large set of [Drying Racks](/wiki/Drying_Rack "Drying Rack") (10 to 20) can be a great help, allowing Rabbits and Birds (which continue to spawn during Winter) to be turned into [Small Jerky](/wiki/Small_Jerky "Small Jerky"), restoring 10 Sanity each. In fact, living off [Traps](/wiki/Trap "Trap") and Drying Racks is a simple and sustainable way to conquer hunger and sanity during winter.

* Perishable items spoil 25% slower than normal during Winter, and [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice") will not melt at all due to the subzero temperature. In fact, food items with a default lifetime of at least 10 days will stay fresh for almost the entire season if stored in an insulated container such as an [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box").

## Snow[]

Snow is basically winter rain; it will make the turf snowy thus making it hard to see roads and paths. It will also add a layer of snow to objects such as Trees or [Science Machines](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine"). Setting rain to lots (infinite) on world presets will make infinite snow during winter. Snow causes the characters body temperature to slightly decrease. Snow does not damage [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") the same way rain does. Snow will all melt away when it turns to [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer"), or if it rains during the Winter.

In the *Reign of Giants* DLC, [Mini Glaciers](/wiki/Mini_Glacier "Mini Glacier") will form during Winter, and freezing is a possibility in [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") and [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins"). In addition to this, Night and Dusk are even longer during Winter in the DLC, taking a bigger hit on sanity for those who are unprepared. The DLC adds some new insulating items, like the [Hibearnation Vest](/wiki/Hibearnation_Vest "Hibearnation Vest"), to help fend off the cold.

[Birchnut Trees](/wiki/Birchnut_Tree "Birchnut Tree") are also not aggressive during Winter, and they have no leaves or [Birchnuts](/wiki/Birchnut "Birchnut") left on them.

Winter in *Reign of Giants* leads to Spring.

## Don't Starve Together icon Don't Starve Together[]

In *Don't Starve Together*, the [Loot Stash](/wiki/Loot_Stash "Loot Stash") will spawn in the [Deciduous Forest](/wiki/Deciduous_Forest "Deciduous Forest") or [Mosaic](/wiki/Mosaic "Mosaic") biome. An attempt to unlock it with a [Deer Antler](/wiki/Deer_Antler "Deer Antler") will spawn [Klaus](/wiki/Klaus "Klaus").

In addition, present [No-Eyed Deers](/wiki/No-Eyed_Deer "No-Eyed Deer") will grow Deer Antlers on their head and can be dropped if they collide into a solid object, such as a [Tree](/wiki/Tree "Tree").

## Prototype Tips[]

* A [Bee Box](/wiki/Bee_Box "Bee Box") may be harvested during Winter without the retaliation of any Bees. While a Bee Box will not produce honey during the season, the honey produced prior will not begin to spoil until harvested, making reserves of honey a very valuable source of food during Winter.
* Pengulls’ tendency to gang up on creatures that attack them makes camping near Pengull breeding grounds a surprisingly effective method of dealing with [Hound](/wiki/Hound "Hound") waves during winter. By hiding with a [Bush Hat](/wiki/Bush_Hat "Bush Hat") right before the first group of Hounds spawns, they will not immediately notice the player and instead choose to attack the nearby flock of Pengulls, creating lots of [Jet Feathers](/wiki/Feather "Feather"), [Drumsticks](/wiki/Drumstick "Drumstick"), [Morsels](/wiki/Morsel "Morsel"), [Eggs](/wiki/Eggs "Eggs"), [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat"), [Hound Teeth](/wiki/Hound%27s_Tooth "Hound's Tooth") and even [Blue Gems](/wiki/Blue_Gem "Blue Gem") for you to pick up. Furthermore, the winning party would likely have been sufficiently weakened that the player can finish off any stragglers by themselves.
* Warm clothing does not help increase body temperature in and of itself; it only stops it from decreasing as fast. Taking warm clothing off during the night when by a fire saves the durability on the clothes.
* In a desperate situation, [Torches](/wiki/Torch "Torch") or [Willow’s Lighter](/wiki/Willow%27s_Lighter "Willow's Lighter") may be used to set flammable objects on fire, which will keep the player warm until the fire burns out. Players should be careful though, as standing too close to a wild fire will cause damage (unless playing as [Willow](/wiki/Willow "Willow")).
* There is a [Chest](/wiki/Chest "Chest") (part of a [Set Piece](/wiki/Set_Piece "Set Piece")) which may spawn in a Forest biome, between a Thermal Measurer and an [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box"). The Chest itself contains an assortment of winter-related items such as an [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff"), a [Winter Hat](/wiki/Winter_Hat "Winter Hat"), and a [Breezy Vest](/wiki/Breezy_Vest "Breezy Vest"). However, upon opening the chest, winter will start immediately. Destroying the chest with a [Hammer](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer") drops its loot, but still triggers the trap. However, opening the chest when it is already Winter will have no adverse effects and provide one with several helpful items to survive the cold for free.
  + In the *Reign of Giants* DLC, there is a version of this set piece that starts Summer instead. The two can be told apart by the presence of [Cacti](/wiki/Cactus "Cactus") in the Summer version. Importantly, opening the Ice Box is NOT safe and will start summer (unlike the winter version)
* [Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie") cannot freeze when he is in his [Werebeaver](/wiki/Werebeaver "Werebeaver") form.
* It is highly recommended to make a Thermal Stone before Winter, and heat it up before exploring. Thermal Stones will prevent the player from Freezing when heated.

Standard attire for Winter is a Winter Hat paired with a Thermal Stone, as well as [Logs](/wiki/Logs "Logs") and [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass") to start Fires when Freezing.

* Players that are using character with increased hunger drain such as [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes"), [Warly](/wiki/Warly "Warly") or [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang") will find the [Hibearnation Vest](/wiki/Hibearnation_Vest "Hibearnation Vest") very helpful as it slows down hunger and delays freezing, often making up for the reduced inventory space.
* [Fruits](/wiki/Fruit "Fruit") and [vegetables](/wiki/Vegetable "Vegetable") are best eaten and/or cooked first during Winter, as very few of them grow during the season, and meats can easily be hunted and dried into Jerky.

Spring depicted in a promotional image for *Reign of Giants*.

 

**“**My clothes appear to be permeable.**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

**Spring** is one of the four **seasons** from the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC, indicated in appearance by the world having a greenish tint.

It has a 50% chance to be the starting season instead of [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn") when playing in [Survival Mode](/wiki/Survival_Mode "Survival Mode"). With the Default Preferences, it lasts 20 days. Therefore, the first Spring lasts either from day 1 to 20, or from day 37 to 56. During the beginning and especially the middle of Spring, [Dusks](/wiki/Dusk "Dusk") are very long (affecting player's sanity) but they quickly go shorter towards the last third of the season. Stages in [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") may have different seasonal variations. Some characteristics in the world change in Spring, and surviving can become more difficult.

## Changes in the World[]

* During Spring, [Mini Glaciers](/wiki/Mini_Glacier "Mini Glacier") will begin to melt and [Bees](/wiki/Bee "Bee") will become red and more hostile (though they are still not considered [Killer Bees](/wiki/Killer_Bee "Killer Bee")).

* [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo")s will enter mating phase and stay in the mating phase for the full season.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/d/dd/Goose.png/revision/latest?cb=20231211202100 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/d/dd/Goose.png/revision/latest?cb=20231211202100 

The giant of Spring: Moose/Goose.

 

* Flowers will randomly spawn during spring even when there are no insects around.

* [Rabbit Holes](/wiki/Rabbit_Hole "Rabbit Hole") close during Spring, forcing the player to look for a different food source.

* The [Moose/Goose](/wiki/Moose/Goose "Moose/Goose") and its nest can be encountered during Spring.

* [Lureplants](/wiki/Lureplant "Lureplant") will naturally spawn in areas that the player has explored. Additionally, [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") will always be in heat and [Blue Hounds](/wiki/Hound#Blue_Hound "Hound") can spawn with Hound waves.
* [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") will start to bloom during this season.
* Maximum chase time and range for enemies is increased by 33%.
* Trees take 25% less time to grow to next stage.

## Rain and its effects[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness")*

Spring is the season where [rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") is very frequent and puddles form on the ground that will completely dry out in [Summer](/wiki/Seasons/Summer "Seasons/Summer").

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/6a/Wetness Meter.png/revision/latest?cb=20190617115124 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/6a/Wetness Meter.png/revision/latest?cb=20190617115124 

The Wetness Meter.

 

Constant rain means that [fuel](/wiki/Fire#Fuel_Values "Fire") is less efficient when lighting fires and more of it is needed to maintain a [fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire"). In particular way, [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") players must be more aware of this menace because of the damage taken from water and [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness"). Additionally, [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") strikes are much more frequent in Spring and can cause damage to the player (though representing an advantage for WX-78) or to unprotected structures vulnerable to fire. There is also a chance of [Frog Rain](/wiki/Frog_Rain "Frog Rain")s occurring.

While temperature is not an issue at this time of year, the player will occasionally [freeze](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") due to wetness, especially during the start of the season because of the low temperatures.

Rain from the surface seeps into the soil, causing the [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") and [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") to drip water from their ceiling, having the same effect as rain (this means higher [Sanity Loss](/wiki/Sanity_Loss "Sanity Loss") to account for), albeit the Wetness meter will rise significantly slower. Note that rain in the underground is constant in Spring and will keep going on until the season ends.

Frequent rain makes tracking [Koalefants](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant") and other creatures from [Suspicious Dirt Piles](/wiki/Suspicious_Dirt_Pile "Suspicious Dirt Pile") more difficult due to tracks disappearing.

[Meats](/wiki/Meats "Meats") hung on a [Drying Rack](/wiki/Drying_Rack "Drying Rack") won't dry if it's raining. Other than that, the drying process will become slower due to humidity.

On the positive side, rain causes crops to grow much quicker and [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms") can be picked more frequently as rain causes them to regenerate. [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bushes "Berry Bushes") and other pickable plants also regenerate 33% faster.

**“**It might be okay if it was cooler.**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f6/Summer RoG poster.png/revision/latest?cb=20171003202601 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f6/Summer RoG poster.png/revision/latest?cb=20171003202601 

*Reign of Giants* Summer depicted in a promotional image.

 

Summer lasts for 15 days from day 56 to 71 with default world settings. The surface world takes on a yellow-orange tint which changes in brightness periodically (as opposed to the blue tint of winter) and little pollen/dust motes appear in the air. Sound effects and music are frequency filtered to sound thin and disant.

Days are much longer in Summer, nights average length, and Dusk the shortest, lasting just one segment during mid-season. Longer days make daylight-related [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") less of an issue than in other seasons.

[Red Hounds](/wiki/Red_Hound "Red Hound") appear during periodic [Hound](/wiki/Hound "Hound") waves in summer. They present a severe fire danger to bases (they ignite when killed) and are an important source of [Red Gems](/wiki/Red_Gem "Red Gem"), which are relatively rare until the first summer.

Overheating, wildfires, and Antlion's disturbances combine to make Summer the most challenging season of the game on the surface world.

## Overheating[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating")*

Similar to [freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") in the Winter, an unprotected player will suffer damage from [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") in Summer. There are many strategies to "beat the heat" such as standing in the shade of a leaf-bearing [tree](/wiki/Tree "Tree"), carrying a cooled [Thermal Stone](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone"), or wearing an [Eyebrella](/wiki/Eyebrella "Eyebrella"). Some characters are more sensitive to heat ([Woodie](/wiki/Woodie "Woodie")) while others ([Willow](/wiki/Willow "Willow") or [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") in bloom) are less so.

## Wildfires[]

The Summer season is marked by severe drought, and items will periodically [ignite](/wiki/Fire "Fire"). Wildfires occur only during the day, on the surface world, outside the Oasis desert and not under fully-grown [Knobbly Trees](/wiki/Knobbly_Tree "Knobbly Tree").
When the world temperature is above 80 degrees, every 45 seconds, burnable objects within 6¼ pitchfork tiles (25 wall-units) of any player attempt to catch fire. There is a 20% chance that this attempt will succeed. This includes plants, such as [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush"), mobs, and even structures like the [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine"). [Lureplants](/wiki/Lureplants "Lureplants") have a higher smoldering priority than other items. Some items, like [Rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks") and [Pearl's Pearl](/wiki/Pearl%27s_Pearl "Pearl's Pearl") are fireproof and will never smolder or catch fire.

An object nearing its combustible point will smolder and visually smoke for a few seconds before igniting. The player's character will comment on it when it is examined. Fires will cause nearby flammable objects to smolder, then ignite, quickly spreading the fire.

Wickerbottom's [Pyrokinetics Explained](/wiki/Books#Pyrokinetics_Explained "Books") might be the quickest and most thorough way of extinguishing fires, but individual smoldering objects can be manually extinguished by clicking on them (causing 3-5 damage). Other practical fire extinguishing methods include the [Ice Flingomatic](/wiki/Ice_Flingomatic "Ice Flingomatic"), [Watering Can](/wiki/Watering_Can "Watering Can"), [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff"), or even applying Ice or [Fertilizer](/wiki/Fertilizer "Fertilizer").

When Structures have been burnt down, players can hammer them down to recover half the components, including single components.

Objects only combust when near the player during daytime and may be protected by simply staying away from them until Autumn.

It is common for players to spend the summer or even base somewhere that fires are not a problem, such as the Oasis, the Caves, or under fully-grown [Knobbly Trees](/wiki/Knobbly_Tree "Knobbly Tree"). The Oasis provides no protection against overheating, but the other areas do.

## Wetness and Plants[]

Most summers will pass without any rain whatsoever, but rain is still possible and some summers have 1 or 2 short rain events (that are not started by the player). High heat and no rain results in world moisture quickly reaching zero.

Small plants ([Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling"), [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft"), etc.) will wilt in the dry heat, but can be returned to normal with water or [Fertilizer](/wiki/Fertilizer "Fertilizer"). [Watering Cans](/wiki/Watering_Can "Watering Can") are particularly helpful for garden moisture, but balloons, a [Fire Pump](/wiki/Fire_Pump "Fire Pump") or even [Spittlefish](/wiki/Ocean_Fishes#Spittlefish "Ocean Fishes") will water anything smouldering, or on fire, wetting the ground beneath it. Ice flingomatics will keep saplings and shrubs from wilting, but do not water garden crops, though they constantly throw snowballs at them. [Dragon Fruit](/wiki/Dragon_Fruit "Dragon Fruit") plants are immune to wilting and smoldering.

Groups of pine trees will petrify during summer, providing a renewable source of rocks, flint, and occasional other minerals at the cost of available wood.

Non-petrified plants return to normal a few days into [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn"), even without fertilizer. Fertilized crops will grow faster due to longer daylight but not as fast as during a moist spring, unless given supplementary moisture.

## Caves[]

In the caves, Spring, Summer, and Fall are indistinguishable except by the total rainfall which is highest in Spring, near-zero in Summer, and moderate in the Fall. This makes summer an ideal time to explore the caves or ruins as thermal protection can be completely ignored and wetness protection is usually unneeded. Cave bases and gardens benefit from 100% wildfire and overheating protection if the survivor can mitigate the sanity drain of the low light.

## Spoilage[]

During Summer, food spoils 25% faster.

## Oasis Desert[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, the Oasis Desert undergoes the biggest changes during summer. [Antlion](/wiki/Antlion "Antlion") emerges on the first dry day (to cause sinkholes on the surface and cave-ins in the caves). A [Sandstorm](/wiki/Sandstorm "Sandstorm") covers the entire Oasis desert when the environment is dry, reducing survivor movement speed and visibility. [Cactus](/wiki/Cactus "Cactus") will yield [Cactus Flowers](/wiki/Cactus_Flower "Cactus Flower") when picked during Summer.

## Tips[]

* A [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter") can be worn all summer in the caves without overheating and will even give a slight positive sanity boost beyond counteracting the low-light sanity drain of the caves.
* [Knobbly Trees](/wiki/Knobbly_Tree "Knobbly Tree") can be grown on the surface and bases built under them to completely eliminate overheating and wildfires under their 7-9 tile diameter of shade. Wildfires can still start outside this radius and Above-Average Tree Trunks can burn, so an Ice Flingomatic or aware survivors with watering cans and ice staffs are still highly recommended. These trees can be grown 7-8 tiles apart to cover wide areas of the surface world with shade. Small areas like [Hermit Island](/wiki/Hermit_Island "Hermit Island") and parts of the [Lunar Archipelago](/wiki/Lunar_Archipelago "Lunar Archipelago") can be completely shaded this way.
* An [Eyebrella](/wiki/Eyebrella "Eyebrella") or even [Umbrella](/wiki/Umbrella "Umbrella") provides excellent heat protection for short periods of time.
* Woodie is more vulnerable to overheating than other characters. He may want to seek shelter under several closely-planted trees during the day, then run to the caves on the first evening to remain underground until Autumn.
* Lureplants smolder sooner than anything else. Placing them just inside the ice flingomatic radius will concentrate all smoldering on the plant which the flingomatic will extinguish. This effectively adds a smolder-free radius around the lureplant to extend the flingomatic's range. This does not extinguish fires outside the flingomatic's original range, just prevents smoldering from starting there.

There are only 2 seasons and **Summer** there works just like Autumn in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode") worlds have different seasonal variations.

The [Dragonfly](/wiki/Dragonfly "Dragonfly") can occasionally be encountered. It will roam around the landscape, setting nearby structures on fire. [Verification Needed]

**“**Ahoy!**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

**Mild Season**, or **Calm Season** is a [Season](/wiki/Season "Season") in the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* DLC. It is equivalent to [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn") in [*Reign of Giants*](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants"), or [Temperate](/wiki/Seasons/Temperate "Seasons/Temperate") in [*Hamlet*](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet"), lasting 20 days. In Mild Season, the days are long and nights are short at the beginning but as of the middle of the season, days get shorter and nights longer. Mild Season is the default season in which a player begins the game and is indicated by a saturated color scheme. When following previous [Dry Season](/wiki/Seasons/Dry "Seasons/Dry"), the first day still has intense [Volcano](/wiki/Volcano "Volcano") eruptions. [Strong Winds](/wiki/Strong_Winds "Strong Winds") and [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") can occur during the second half of Mild Season, but are far less severe and less frequent than the events that will occur during the following [Hurricane Season](/wiki/Seasons/Hurricane "Seasons/Hurricane").

[Seagulls](/wiki/Birds "Birds") and [Cormorants](/wiki/Birds "Birds") may be found in the [Ocean](/wiki/Ocean "Ocean") while sailing during this Season. More valuable drops are rarer when fishing with [Trawl Net](/wiki/Trawl_Net "Trawl Net") during Mild Season.

Due to a lack of [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating"), [Flooding](/wiki/Flooding "Flooding") and other hazards, Mild Season is the best time to explore, gather resources and prepare for other seasons, especially Hurricane Season. [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") is usually relatively easy to maintain because of long days and low frequency of rain. Mild Season is followed by Hurricane Season. Due to the harsh nature of Hurricane Season, it would be the player's best interest to use Mild Season to prepare for the [Lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning"), Rain, Strong Winds, and the seasonal boss, [Sealnado](/wiki/Sealnado "Sealnado"), that await them.

**“**Take that, wind!**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

**Hurricane Season** is one of the four **seasons** from the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC. It is equivalent to [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter"), and is indicated by the screen taking on a bluish tint.

Like winter, by default Hurricane Season begins on day 21 and ends on day 37, following the end of the [Mild Season](/wiki/Mild_Season "Mild Season"). In Hurricane Season, the days are relatively short with all 3 cycles of daylight being relatively equal in length during the later half of the season. Unlike Winter, freezing is not an issue, plants still grow normally, food spoils at a normal rate, and [Birds](/wiki/Birds "Birds") may drop [Seeds](/wiki/Seeds "Seeds"). Hurricane Season is followed by [Monsoon Season](/wiki/Monsoon_Season "Monsoon Season").

## Changes in the World[]

* Parrots, Parrot Pirates, Toucans, and Cormorants do not appear. Seagulls will appear on [Beaches](/wiki/Beach "Beach"), but won't appear in the [Ocean](/wiki/Ocean "Ocean").
* [Crocodogs](/wiki/Crocodog "Crocodog") have a chance to spawn as a blue variant.
* Large [Waves](/wiki/Waves "Waves") start replacing Common Waves. The probability of large waves appearing increases as the season progresses, and by the end of Hurricane Season only large waves are present.
* [Fireflies](/wiki/Fireflies "Fireflies") stay dormant.
* [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterfly "Butterfly") don't appear.
* [Bees](/wiki/Bee "Bee") don't leave [Bee Boxes](/wiki/Bee_Box "Bee Box") and thus don't produce any [Honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey").
* Obsidian tools don't gain any charges.
* [Shoals](/wiki/Shoal "Shoal") disperse, making them unreliable as a food source.
* Using the [Trawl Net](/wiki/Trawl_Net "Trawl Net") provides a better variety of catch than compared to [Mild Season](/wiki/Mild_Season "Mild Season") or Monsoon Season, but not as much as during [Dry Season](/wiki/Dry_Season "Dry Season").
* [Birds of the World](/wiki/Birds_of_the_World "Birds of the World") doesn't work.

## Storms[]

During Hurricane Season, storms periodically visit the world. The storms have different stages of progression.

1. The sky slightly darkens.
2. Strong Winds will start blowing.
3. It will start raining and [Hail](/wiki/Hail "Hail") will fall.
4. The rumbling of approaching thunder can be heard.
5. Lightning starts striking every few seconds. The storm is at its peak.
6. Lightning stops striking. The rumbling of passing thunder can be heard.
7. Strong Winds stop being blown.
8. Hail and rain stops falling.
9. The sky returns to normal brightness.

## Prototype Strategy[]

Lightning Strikes are dangerous to flammable items and structures, as well as the player. To protect oneself from Lightning, a [Lightning Rod](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod") can be used to divert Lightning away from harm's reach. Lightning Rods cannot be built at sea, so staying on land or close to is essential to prevent Lightning from striking the player. Alternatively, insulating clothing will protect the player from Lightning Strikes. Beware however, as Lightning will still set aflame any flammable items or structures the player was close to on impact. Lightning commonly only produces a distinct audio effect and lights up the screen, without actually summoning a Lightning Strike. During Lightning Strikes the player is protected from [Charlie's](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") attacks at night.

If playing as [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78"), Hurricane Season provides excessive amounts of charges for SYSTEM OVERLOAD. This drastically reduces the need to carry around light-emitting items, frequently heals WX-78 and speeds up their movement. Beware that sanity will quickly deplete this way, but the speed and healing helps fighting Shadow Creatures. If actively avoiding Lightning Rods, SYSTEM OVERLOAD may last as long as up to the start of Mild Season.

Rain can drastically reduce one's sanity if their equipped items become wet. Water insulating clothing such as the [Snakeskin Hat](/wiki/Snakeskin_Hat "Snakeskin Hat") and [Jacket](/wiki/Snakeskin_Jacket "Snakeskin Jacket") helps staying dry, as well standing under a [Palm Leaf Hut](/wiki/Palm_Leaf_Hut "Palm Leaf Hut").

[Strong Winds](/wiki/Strong_Winds "Strong Winds") slow down, or speed up movement. To lessen the slowing of Strong Winds a [Sleek Hat](/wiki/Sleek_Hat "Sleek Hat") or [Windbreaker](/wiki/Windbreaker "Windbreaker") can be used. Strong Winds cut most plants, even big ones such as trees. This can be especially harmful to Honey farms as Flowers get completely uprooted and do not grow back. Strong Winds also quickly extinguish Camp Fires, Fire Pits and their [Endothermic](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire "Endothermic Fire") counterparts. Together with the long night makes darkness a dangerous threat. [Chimineas](/wiki/Chiminea "Chiminea") and [Obsidian Fire Pits](/wiki/Obsidian_Fire_Pit "Obsidian Fire Pit") are immune to Strong Winds and are an excellent replacement for normal fires.

Hail quickly melts, but can be stored in Ice Boxes indefinitely. Hail can be used to extinguish fire, or refined into Ice. Ice is useful as an ingredient or filler for certain [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") recipes.

There is a chance, but no guarantee, that the [Sealnado](/wiki/Sealnado "Sealnado") will spawn near the end of the season. The Sealnado is rather dangerous, but can be distracted by other mobs or allowed to spawn away from the player's base.

The [Tiger Shark](/wiki/Tiger_Shark "Tiger Shark") also has an increased chance to be encountered in Hurricane Season in comparison to Mild Season. Previously, the Tiger Shark could only be spawned by Fishing, baiting [Sea Traps](/wiki/Sea_Trap "Sea Trap"), or netting [Bioluminescence](/wiki/Bioluminescence "Bioluminescence") and [Jellyfish](/wiki/Jellyfish "Jellyfish"). In Hurricane Season, riding waves, attacking creatures at sea and eating at sea has a chance to spawn her as well. Fighting the Tiger Shark gives an early advantage by acquiring the [Dumbrella](/wiki/Dumbrella "Dumbrella") or locating her den when she flees at low health.

**“**The water is too rough!**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

**Monsoon Season**, or **Green Season**, is a **Season** in the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* DLC. It is equivalent to [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"). Monsoon Season is indicated with the world having bluish green tint. By default, it begins on day 37 and ends on day 56. During Monsoon Season, nights gradually become shorter with days becoming longer. Dusk stays longer.

[Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") will start to bloom during this season.

Rain during Monsoon Season causes patches of land to be flooded. The first days of monsoon seasons are relatively rain-free. However, as the season progresses, rain becomes more frequent and flooding worsens until most of the land is flooded during the end of the season. Lightning, while present, is less frequent than during [Hurricane Season](/wiki/Hurricane_Season "Hurricane Season") and [Strong Winds](/wiki/Strong_Winds "Strong Winds") do not occur. Frequent rain means [Crops](/wiki/Crops "Crops"), [Grass](/wiki/Grass "Grass"), [Twigs](/wiki/Twigs "Twigs") and other pickable plants will grow 33% faster.

Maximum chase time and range for enemies is increased by 33%. Trees take 25% less time to grow to next stage.

The rains in Monsoon Season come in waves. Each wave will increase the size of the puddle that will flood the areas. Using the Sandbags can permanently remove a puddle when done properly (see [Sandbags](/wiki/Sandbag "Sandbag") and [Flooding](/wiki/Flooding "Flooding") for more information). Certain structures will no longer function when in a puddle. This includes but is not limited to iceboxes, crockpots, alchemy engine, and prestihatitator.

If the player must venture into flooded zones, an [Umbrella](/wiki/Umbrella "Umbrella") combined with a hat with a water resistance rating such as a [Top Hat](/wiki/Top_Hat "Top Hat") or [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet") will prevent the player from getting wet. [Snakeskin Jackets](/wiki/Snakeskin_Jacket "Snakeskin Jacket") and [Hats](/wiki/Snakeskin_Hat "Snakeskin Hat") are good and cheap solutions to combat Wetness if no high-end gear were found from [X Marks the Spot](/wiki/X_Marks_the_Spot "X Marks the Spot") treasure chests. [Blubber Suits](/wiki/Blubber_Suit "Blubber Suit") and [Tar Suits](/wiki/Tar_Suit "Tar Suit") are perhaps the best gear because they completely make the player immune to Wetness, however they do not protect from lightning strikes.

[Poison Mosquitoes](/wiki/Poison_Mosquito "Poison Mosquito") start to appear during Monsoon Season spawning in the flooded areas. [Lureplants](/wiki/Meat_Bulb_(Lureplant) "Meat Bulb (Lureplant)") will also begin to spawn in this season, rendering player-made flooring very effective to combat both puddles and Lureplants.

Like in [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring"), normal [Bees](/wiki/Bee "Bee") become aggressive towards the player. [Crabbit Dens](/wiki/Crabbit_Den "Crabbit Den") collapse within the first days of this season. However, the [Sharkitten Den](/wiki/Sharkitten_Den "Sharkitten Den") opens up and a chance of [Tiger Shark](/wiki/Tiger_Shark "Tiger Shark") to spawn is the highest.

[Trawl Net](/wiki/Trawl_Net "Trawl Net") fishing yields as much catch as during [Mild Season](/wiki/Mild_Season "Mild Season").

Monsoon Season is followed by [Dry Season](/wiki/Dry_Season "Dry Season"). Long-term goal of Monsoon Season is to prepare for Dry Season in advance. It is more easily done within the first half of the season where flooding is not much of an issue and rains are not very frequent.

**“**That can't be good.**”**

–[Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson")

The **Dry Season** (also known as Volcano Season) is one of the four [Seasons](/wiki/Season "Season") in the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* DLC. It is indicated by the world having yellow/orange tint, similar to [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") in *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC. By default, the first Dry Season begins on [day](/wiki/Day "Day") 56 and ends on day 71. During the Dry Season, nights are very short, and dusk starts long but becomes shorter in length as the season progresses.

Within the first days of the season, areas that were [Flooded](/wiki/Flooding "Flooding") during [Monsoon Season](/wiki/Monsoon_Season "Monsoon Season") begin to dry up. The temperatures soon rise to the point where [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") becomes a major issue, especially during the middle of the season. Overheating is not as severe compared to *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Reign_of_Giants "Reign of Giants")* DLC's [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") season, and fires do not spontaneously start. In addition, overheating is usually not an issue during the first and last two days of Dry Season. Most plants like [Bamboo](/wiki/Bamboo "Bamboo"), [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft"), [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush"), and even [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") can wither, making them non-functional unless treated. This effect also extends to [Basic Farms](/wiki/Farm "Farm") and [Improved farms](/wiki/Farm "Farm"), [Limpet Rocks](/wiki/Limpet_Rock "Limpet Rock") can wither as well.

During Dry Season, the ocean is calmer with fewer waves. The waves get less frequent towards the end of the season. Fishing with a [Trawl Net](/wiki/Trawl_Net "Trawl Net") during Dry Season will yield the greatest variety of catch, including a chance to obtain [Obsidian](/wiki/Obsidian "Obsidian").

Dry Season is followed by [Mild Season](/wiki/Mild_Season "Mild Season").

## Volcanic Eruptions[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Volcano (object)#Eruptions](/wiki/Volcano_(object)#Eruptions "Volcano (object)")*

Soon after the flooded areas have dried up completely, the [Volcano](/wiki/Volcano "Volcano") will start to erupt. Tremors occur three times before each eruption, giving slightly more than half of a day to prepare. When the volcano erupts, [Dragoon Eggs](/wiki/Dragoon_Egg "Dragoon Egg") rain down from the sky, each briefly showing a shadow where it will land, and targeting areas within and slightly beyond the player's view.

## Prototype Strategy[]

Since falling Dragoon Eggs tend to cause havoc, it is recommended to leave any established bases and retreat to a location with no or few combustible resources. The best places for this are barren landscapes and Shallow Ocean. Medium or Deep Ocean is recommended more during the middle of the season where overheating is a major problem and wetness can provide emergency cooldown. The ocean is a less viable option during the last days of the season when the frequency of eruptions rises dramatically. Fortunately by that point, overheating is less of a problem.

Don't Starve Shipwrecked Dodging Meteors

a way to dodge meteors that rain down from the sky during Dry Season

 

The ashes that cover the screen during an eruption may hinder vision and make the shadows cast by the falling Dragoon Eggs harder to see. This makes places with darker turf, like [Magma Fields](/wiki/Magma_Field "Magma Field"), potentially dangerous places to ride out an eruption. Therefore, a sacrificial beach for volcanic eruptions may be needed. It is also a good idea to wear [Armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor") while dodging Dragoon Eggs on land. Wearing a [Log Suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit") with maximum [Health](/wiki/Health "Health") will allow any character to survive a direct hit. Combining a stronger armor with a helmet (such as a [Football Helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet")) will allow surviving multiple hits. For eruptions happening at night, a [Campfire](/wiki/Campfire "Campfire") or [Endothermic Fire](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire "Endothermic Fire") can be built for protection from [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") and to be able to see the shadows of falling Dragoon Eggs. However, these can be destroyed if any eggs strike near them. While [Torches](/wiki/Torch "Torch") can be used, they do not provide a large light radius. Therefore, the best option is to use a [Bottle Lantern](/wiki/Bottle_Lantern "Bottle Lantern") or a [Miner Hat](/wiki/Miner_Hat "Miner Hat"). Landing Dragoon Eggs will sometimes form [Lava Pools](/wiki/Lava_Pool "Lava Pool"), which provide light with a fairly large radius, allowing the light source to be unequipped to save their durability. [Obsidian Fire Pits](/wiki/Obsidian_Fire_Pit "Obsidian Fire Pit") are another alternative for providing light during a night eruption as a fully fueled Obsidian Fire Pit provides light for a large area. However, this may be a bit risky, since if the player gets close to the fire pit, landing Dragoon Eggs can destroy the Obsidian Fire Pit, eliminating the light source.

If the Volcano has been found, another strategy is to prevent eruptions altogether by going inside and making offerings to the [Volcano Altar of Snackrifice](/wiki/Volcano_Altar_of_Snackrifice "Volcano Altar of Snackrifice"). Building a small base inside the Volcano and spending the duration of Dry season there can allow the player to survive, collect resources specific to the Volcano biome, and continuously make offerings of appeasement with relatively low effort. [Eggs](/wiki/Eggs "Eggs") provide a fairly high appeasement value and can be obtained by feeding cooked [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") to a [bird](/wiki/Birds "Birds") in a [Birdcage](/wiki/Birdcage "Birdcage"). Monster Meat can be obtained by killing [Dragoons](/wiki/Dragoon "Dragoon") inside the Volcano. An [Ice Maker 3000](/wiki/Ice_Maker_3000 "Ice Maker 3000") and a [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") can subsequently nullify the player's hunger problems, as the [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") and [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice") can be used to make [Meatballs](/wiki/Meatballs "Meatballs"). The ice can also be eaten to cool the player if [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") occurs. The majority of the materials needed to craft these structures can be found inside the Volcano itself. [Turf](/wiki/Turf "Turf") inside the volcano, though non-renewable, can be used as an easy-to-obtain fuel source for fire pits (an [Endothermic Fire Pit](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire_Pit "Endothermic Fire Pit") is recommended) and for the [Ice Maker 3000](/wiki/Ice_Maker_3000 "Ice Maker 3000"). The time spent between making offerings can be used to gather resources that are only found in the Volcano, such as [Obsidian](/wiki/Obsidian "Obsidian"), [Coffee Plants](/wiki/Coffee_Plant "Coffee Plant") and [Elephant Cacti](/wiki/Elephant_Cactus "Elephant Cactus").

In the dry season land based food sources such as [Farms](/wiki/Farming "Farming") or [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush") become effectively unusable preparing alternate sources such as trawl nets or fishing poles will be very advantageous. Alternatively if you have a large amount of [Manure](/wiki/Manure "Manure"), crops can be quickly grown before they have time to wilt.

In the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC, Volcanic Eruptions do not effect/occur in [interior areas](/wiki/Category:Interiors "Category:Interiors").

The **Temperate Season** is one of three **Seasons** in the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC, starting at day 1 and ending on day 11, for a total of 11 days. Temperate Season is the first season players encounter and is the equivalent to [Autumn](/wiki/Autumn "Autumn") in *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")*, or [Mild](/wiki/Seasons/Mild "Seasons/Mild") in *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")*.

During this season, rain and thunderstorms will occur for short periods of time. [Glowflies](/wiki/Glowfly "Glowfly") will spawn from [Exotic Flowers](/wiki/Exotic_Flower "Exotic Flower") during this season, and near the end of the season they will form cocoons in the [Rainforest](/wiki/Rainforest "Rainforest") which will produce [Rabid Beetles](/wiki/Rabid_Beetle "Rabid Beetle") when the season ends.

Temperate Season leads to [Humid Season](/wiki/Humid_Season "Humid Season"), so players should spend their first Temperate Season preparing for the coming fog and lightning storms. The first 20 or so days should be spent collecting rare resources, such as gold, gems and silk.

**Humid Season** is the second one of three [Seasons](/wiki/Season "Season") in the *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLC, starting on day 12 and ending on day 22, lasting 10 days. It is indicated with the world having a bright blue tint. Humid Season leads to [Lush Season](/wiki/Lush_Season "Lush Season"), so player should prepare for coming [Hay Fever](/wiki/Hay_Fever "Hay Fever"). A few weather changes occur during this season, like intense [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain") and [Heavy Fog](/wiki/Heavy_Fog "Heavy Fog"). during the [Heavy Fog](/wiki/Heavy_Fog "Heavy Fog") the player may run slower if wearing a clothing item, and become wetter over time. It is probable that the [BFB](/wiki/BFB "BFB") will spawn during this time.

## Seasonal Changes[]

* It is comparable to [Spring](/wiki/Spring "Spring") in *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* and [Monsoon Season](/wiki/Monsoon_Season "Monsoon Season") in *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")*, as it rains a lot and [lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning") is common and also [Winter](/wiki/Seasons/Winter "Seasons/Winter") since mobs such as [Butterflies](/wiki/Butterfly "Butterfly") and [Glowflies](/wiki/Glowfly "Glowfly") wont spawn during the season.
* [Heavy Fog](/wiki/Heavy_Fog "Heavy Fog") will surround the player often in this season
* Glowflies turn into Glowfly Cocoons, and then become [Rabid Beetles](/wiki/Rabid_Beetle "Rabid Beetle").
* [Great Leafy Stalks](/wiki/Great_Leafy_Stalk "Great Leafy Stalk") have a chance to spawn Glowfly Cocoons around them.

While the fog is around, the player's character will announce that their current armor or hat is too hot (Although, the player won't increase temperature or overheat) or too heavy and will move at a reduced speed. Taking off the clothing will make the player move back at normal speed.

The [Pith Hat](/wiki/Pith_Hat "Pith Hat") and [Cowl](/wiki/Cowl "Cowl") will negate the slowness that fog causes, allowing the use of the torso slot without being slowed. The [Weevole Mantle](/wiki/Weevole_Mantle "Weevole Mantle") will also cancel out the slowness that fog causes.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* In the *Hamlet* closed beta, Humid season didn't have its own work music, and instead played the [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") theme from the base game, but it did have its own unique combat theme. As of now, it has its own work theme.

*Exclusive to:* Hamlet

Lush Season is the third season in Don't Starve: Hamlet. It comes after the Humid Season, the main features of this season are brambles and allergies. During this season, most plants change texture to bloom. With standard settings, it starts on day 23 and ends on day 34. The beginning of the season is accompanied by rare gusts of wind.

During the flowering season, [Tuber Trees](/wiki/Tuber_Tree "Tuber Tree") begin to bloom. You can learn about this by the presence of greenery and flowers on the tree. When chopping a tree this season, [Blooming Tubers](/wiki/Tuber "Tuber") drops out of it, which, unlike immature tubers, do not poison the character when eaten.

When the flowering season arrives, brambles appear in several biomes. Most often, they simply block the path, so that they can simply be bypassed - otherwise, the thickets can be dispersed, but each hit on them inflicts 3 damage to the character. damage. Wormwood can absorb damage with a [Bramble Husk](/wiki/Bramble_Husk "Bramble Husk"). Blooming brambles can be found in the [Bramble Bloom](/wiki/Bramble_Bloom "Bramble Bloom"), the [Bramble Bulb](/wiki/Bramble_Bulb "Bramble Bulb") of which can be used to create a [Dense Turf](/wiki/Dense_Turf "Dense Turf").

Pollen causes [Hay Fever](/wiki/Hay_Fever "Hay Fever"). During the pollen period, the screen becomes cloudy from the edges to the center; after the character sneezes, the screen clears a bit. When a character sneezes, a random item drops out of the inventory, as if taking damage from a frog or creeper, and sanity decreases. To avoid allergies, you should create a [gas mask](/wiki/Gas_Mask "Gas Mask"), eat [nettles](/wiki/Nettle "Nettle") (the best option would be to make [Meated Nettles](/wiki/Meated_Nettles "Meated Nettles")) and [Seed Pod](/wiki/Seed_Pod "Seed Pod").

## Seasonal Changes[]

* [Brambles](/wiki/Bramble "Bramble") begin to grow across various biomes in the world.
* [Bramble Blooms](/wiki/Bramble_Bloom "Bramble Bloom") will appear around Brambles in the world.
* The player is vulnerable to [Hay Fever](/wiki/Hay_Fever "Hay Fever"), which can be prevented by wearing a [Gas Mask](/wiki/Gas_Mask "Gas Mask"), consuming [Seed Pods](/wiki/Seed_Pod "Seed Pod"), [Nettles](/wiki/Nettle "Nettle"), [Nettle Rolls](/wiki/Nettle_Rolls "Nettle Rolls") or [Meated Nettles](/wiki/Meated_Nettles "Meated Nettles") or being near a working [Oscillating Fan](/wiki/Oscillating_Fan "Oscillating Fan").
* [Strong Winds](/wiki/Strong_Winds "Strong Winds") will occasionally blow during this season.
* [Tuber Trees](/wiki/Tuber_Tree "Tuber Tree") bloom during the Lush Season, allowing [Blooming Tubers](/wiki/Tuber "Tuber") to be consumed without the [poisoning](/wiki/Poison "Poison") effect from eating Tubers procured during the [Temperate](/wiki/Temperate_Season "Temperate Season") and [Humid](/wiki/Humid_Season "Humid Season") seasons.
* [Rainforest Trees](/wiki/Tree/Rainforest "Tree/Rainforest") also bloom in the Lush season, and will drop [Jungle Burrs](/wiki/Jungle_Burr "Jungle Burr") (the equivalent of [Pine Cones](/wiki/Pine_Cone "Pine Cone")) when [Strong Winds](/wiki/Strong_Winds "Strong Winds") blow or they are chopped down. This will allow the player to replant another tree, making Rainforest Trees renewable only in this season.
* [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") will start to bloom.
