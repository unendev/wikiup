***Don't Starve Together*** is the sequel to *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")*, and features the requested multiplayer mechanics.

As of 2023-12-05 on Steam, DST had 294K reviews, DS 88K, Shipwrecked 3K, RoG 1.5K, and Hamlet 1.3K, indicating that DST is at least 3x as popular as DS was. The other DLC's are relatively minor players. Each version has its own charm, but new development takes place almost exclusively in DST.

Don't Starve Together was originally scheduled to come out in Summer 2014,[[1]](#cite_note-1) though a specific date was not given. However, sign-ups for a limited-access, closed Beta were released. It came out on Mac and Linux after being finalized on Windows.

Starting December 15, 2014, *Don't Starve Together Beta* was in [Steam Early Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access "wikipedia:Early access"), and on June 3, 2015, *Don't Starve Together Early Access* was released for free to owners of *Don't Starve* on Steam. It left early access and was fully released on April 21, 2016. *Don't Starve* and *Don't Starve Together* can be bought individually or as a bundle.

## Features[]

*Don't Starve Together* has multiple ways to play with others: LAN, network, and matchmaking play. Many items have been balanced or removed in order to keep the game fair. PvP are optional by the server operator. [Dedicated](/wiki/Don%E2%80%99t_Starve_Together_Dedicated_Servers "Don’t Starve Together Dedicated Servers"), player-hosted and LAN servers are available, and chat is global or local depending on the server admin's preference. A type of server called "Friends Only" allows a server to be created whereby the only people who can join have to be on the hosting player's Steam friends list. Many [console commands](/wiki/Console/Don%27t_Starve_Together_Commands "Console/Don't Starve Together Commands") have changed or been removed for DST.

| --- | --- |
| https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/7e/Playstyle Relaxed.png/revision/latest?cb=20240506182315 | **Relaxed** - A more relaxed playstyle with less threats from the world. Survivors will not die from starvation, freezing, overheating, or the darkness. Damage to survivors is reduced. Resurrection is always available via the Florid Postern. |
| https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/fe/Playstyle Survival.png/revision/latest?cb=20240506182321 | **Survival** is the default mode. It is intended to be a cooperative, more difficult mode, in which [dead](/wiki/Death "Death") players become [Ghost Characters](/wiki/Ghost_Characters "Ghost Characters") (see below). When all players are dead, a 120-second timer starts, and if no players are revived in that time, the world resets. |
| https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/8/8c/Playstyle Wilderness.png/revision/latest?cb=20240506182333 | **Wilderness** mode spawns players in random locations across the map. Players who die are returned to the character select screen, allowing them to respawn in a new random location as a new [character](/wiki/Characters "Characters") with their [map](/wiki/Map "Map") progress wiped. No resurrection items exist, including [touchstones](/wiki/Touchstone "Touchstone") (although their [set pieces](/wiki/Set_Piece "Set Piece") with [pig heads](/wiki/Pig_Head "Pig Head") will still be generated). The world never resets. |
| https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/fb/Playstyle Endless.png/revision/latest?cb=20240506182327 | **Endless** mode is intended to be a more relaxed mode that doesn't force players to cooperate. It is similar to the Survival mode, except that the world never resets, and that Ghost players may additionally resurrect themselves at the [spawn portal](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern") when they die, as many times as they wish. |
| https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/3/3a/Playstyle Light out.png/revision/latest?cb=20240506182342 | **Light out** - A dark twist on the standard Don't Starve experience. |

#### Caves[]

Caves can be activated or deactivated. This can be chosen after selecting the playstyle.

| https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/64/Playstyle Caves.png/revision/latest?cb=20240506182346 | **Caves** - *"Requires more PC Power as it runs multiple servers"* |
| https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/4/4a/Playstyle No Caves.png/revision/latest?cb=20240506182351 | **No Caves** - *"Sad, but not as demanding on a computer"* |

### Ghosts[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/11/DST everyone%27s dead.png/revision/latest?cb=20150719055840 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/1/11/DST everyone%27s dead.png/revision/latest?cb=20150719055840 

The dialogue box that appears when everyone has died.

 

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Ghost Characters](/wiki/Ghost_Characters "Ghost Characters")*

[Ghost Players](/wiki/Ghost_Players "Ghost Players") are a new feature that introduces the ability to live after death, although in a downgraded state. Whenever a player dies, a skeleton spawns at their death point. Their inventory is dropped, and they become a ghost. Upon death, [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") also loses their upgrades. Ghosts can [Haunt](/wiki/Haunt "Haunt") items and structures, possibly setting objects on fire, or affecting them in some other way.

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/9/99/Telltale Heart.png/revision/latest?cb=20141210082922 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/9/99/Telltale Heart.png/revision/latest?cb=20141210082922 

A [Telltale Heart](/wiki/Telltale_Heart "Telltale Heart").

 

A ghost can be resurrected using a [Touch Stone](/wiki/Touch_Stone "Touch Stone"), [Meat Effigy](/wiki/Meat_Effigy "Meat Effigy"), [Life Giving Amulet](/wiki/Life_Giving_Amulet "Life Giving Amulet"), or the [Telltale Heart](/wiki/Telltale_Heart "Telltale Heart"). Players may also resurrect through the [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern") or [Celestial Portal](/wiki/Celestial_Portal "Celestial Portal") if server operator enable the "Revive At Florid Postern" [Customization](/wiki/World_Customization_Don%27t_Starve_Together "World Customization Don't Starve Together") . When the ghost re-spawns, their inventory will be empty and their hunger and sanity are set to the same as [resurrection](/wiki/Resurrection "Resurrection") in the base game.

Being resurrected with the Telltale Heart or with the Florid Postern Portal also incurs a **maximum health penalty** on the player. Each resurrection adds 25% to the Health penalty, which caps out at 75% (leaving the player with 25% of their maximum health). The health lost to this penalty can be restored by 25% using a [Booster Shot](/wiki/Booster_Shot "Booster Shot").

Once there is a player ghost in the world, other players will suffer a continuous 3.3/min Sanity sanity drain for each ghost (up to 10/min total).

#### A New Reign[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f0/DST A New Reign Release Poster.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170417182725 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f0/DST A New Reign Release Poster.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170417182725 

*[A New Reign](/wiki/A_New_Reign "A New Reign")* Release Poster.

 

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [A New Reign](/wiki/A_New_Reign "A New Reign")*

A free DLC originally called *Through the Ages* was announced for Spring 2015, and contains new content specifically made for multiplayer, such as mounting [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") using saddles.[[2]](#cite_note-2) However, due to complications with implementing Cave biomes, Klei pushed back the release date. After the Caves made their way into DST and the game went out of Early Access, the DLC was once again announced, now under the name *A New Reign*, and was distributed through an ongoing series of updates.[[3]](#cite_note-3) Some of the features that are officially part of the DLC were incorporated into the game via update on December 23, 2015, much earlier than the Beta Launch of the DLC, August 11, 2016.

#### Return of Them[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a7/DST Turn of Tides Promo.png/revision/latest?cb=20190516205722 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/a/a7/DST Turn of Tides Promo.png/revision/latest?cb=20190516205722 

*[Return of Them](/wiki/Return_of_Them "Return of Them")* Announcement Poster.

 

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Return of Them](/wiki/Return_of_Them "Return of Them")*

*Return of Them* is an expansion to *Don't Starve Together*, styled similarly to *A New Reign*. It adds many new features including sailable waters, a new [Lunar Island](/wiki/Lunar_Island "Lunar Island") area with new biomes, new mobs, craftable items, and more. Its beta branch was both announced and launched on May 16, 2019.[[4]](#cite_note-4)

### Rebalancing[]

Don't Starve Together features [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") and [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins"), which must be toggled on via a tab in the Server Creation menu. The Caves and Ruins now share the same map level, since each map level requires a separate server.

[Thermal Stones](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone") now have [durability](/wiki/Durability "Durability"), intended to represent cracks formed as a result of heating and cooling. [Armor](/wiki/Armor "Armor") has less durability (by 30%) and can no longer be multiplicatively stacked as before; the game now uses the better armor's absorption and then divides the damage absorbed between the two worn armors weighted by their absorption. The [Pan Flute](/wiki/Pan_Flute "Pan Flute") now has the ability to knock other players besides the user unconscious for a short time, if PVP is enabled.

Due to [Gears](/wiki/Gears "Gears") being a less available resource, before their rework, [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78") started with 150 health, sanity, and [hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"), but each set of gears provided less of an upgrade (still bringing it to 300/400/200 overall after 15 upgrades).

[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell") now comes only with his [Codex Umbra](/wiki/Codex_Umbra "Codex Umbra") and 6 [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel"). His [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") boost has been reduced from 20/min to 6.67/min. The [Shadow Tab](/wiki/Shadow_Tab "Shadow Tab") was added, in which one can craft the Codex and different types of puppets. Puppets cost 2 Nightmare Fuel, a tool matching their action, and 20% (worker) or 35% (duelist) of Maxwell's maximum sanity.

Many mobs have had their health increased:

### Sleeping[]

[Sleeping](/wiki/Sleeping "Sleeping") has been significantly changed. Normally, when going to sleep, the day would fast-forward to sunrise and replenish [health](/wiki/Health "Health") and [sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") at the cost of [hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") upon waking up. However, when on a server, sleeping will not fast forward to sunrise but will instead leave the player unable to move and unaffected by the [night monster](/wiki/Charlie_(Night_Monster) "Charlie (Night Monster)"). This will replenish health and sanity while draining hunger faster than normal over time; the rate at which will be dependent on what type of structure or item was used to sleep. When using a normal sleeping item, the player can wake themselves up by trying to move. If the player was put to sleep (pan flute, cooking a mandrake, etc.), they will reawaken after a small amount of time. The player will always wake up if hunger reaches 0.

### Pausing the server[]

Server admins and local hosts can pause or un-pause the game via pause hotkey (P by default). There are also two auto pause option that can be toggled on and off that allowing auto pausing when players opening the menu (Esc by default), map or [console](/wiki/Console/Don%27t_Starve_Together_Commands "Console/Don't Starve Together Commands") window.

The console command

```
TheSim:SetTimeScale(0)

```

can stop the time in the server, and will pause the game to all players. However, the game behavior after that command may be unexpected, and trying the un-pause command

```
TheSim:SetTimeScale(1) 

```

may cause the server to hang completely, forcing to close the game.

### Favorite Food[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Food#Favorite Food](/wiki/Food#Favorite_Food "Food")*

Characters now have a favorite food, which will provide 15 extra Hunger when consumed by the player.

### Exploration[]

The [Map](/wiki/Map "Map") has been modified to include a fog of war, preventing players to see changes to remote locations in the map. Each player's explored areas are tracked separately, however players can share their exploration with others using [Map Scrolls](/wiki/Map_Scroll "Map Scroll").

### Communication[]

Players communicate and express themselves through two chat modes: global chat (accessed via "Y" key by default) and local "whisper" chat (accessed via "U" key by default). Global chat is seen by all players, whether they are up on the Surface world or down inside [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves"). Whispered messages, on the other hand, can only be seen by players who are in the vicinity of the speaker. Whispered chat looks the same as global chat, but the word "Whisper" is displayed before it.

### Emotes[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Emotes](/wiki/Emotes "Emotes")*

Emotes are used by entering their respective commands in chat, such as /happy, /angry, /no, /bonesaw, /dance, /facepalm, /joy, /kiss, /pose, /rude, /cry, /wave, /sit, and /squat. Each emote will trigger an animation by the player's character.

There are also unlockable emotes that are [Event](/wiki/Event "Event") exclusive or can only be unlocked by completing Skin ensembles.

### Reputation[]

Attacking players, giving players items, and reviving ghosts is tracked by the game and can impact what other characters say about said player when inspecting them. For example, if Willow were to inspect a harmless Wilson she would say, "Hi (playername)!". But had he been attacking someone, she would say, "Why, (playername)... that fire in your eyes!" Or if a player has been reviving other players, she will say "(playername) won't leave anyone behind.".

### Curios[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Curio Cabinet](/wiki/Curio_Cabinet "Curio Cabinet")*

https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/6/6a/Wilson Guest of Honor Portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20220312010601

Curios are collectable items exclusive to *Don't Starve Together* that can be used to customize the appearance of players' [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters"), profiles, chat messages and loading screens. There are seven different types of Curios which exist of various rarities: [Skins](/wiki/Skins "Skins"), [Belongings](/wiki/Belongings "Belongings"), [Emotes](/wiki/Emotes "Emotes"), [Emoticons](/wiki/Emoticons "Emoticons"), [Portrait Frames](/wiki/Portrait_Frames "Portrait Frames"), [Profile Icons](/wiki/Profile_Icons "Profile Icons") and [Vignettes](/wiki/Vignettes "Vignettes"). Their purpose is to provide a stronger sense of individuality to players.

Curios are obtainable through randomly timed drops while playing the game, and when opening the game daily. Players can earn up to 15 Curios per week. The weekly reset occurs around 1pm PST every Thursday, right before [Klei Entertainment's](/wiki/Klei_Entertainment "Klei Entertainment") weekly [*Rhymes with Play* Twitch broadcast](https://www.twitch.tv/kleientertainment). Some Curios are excluded from these drops and are only obtainable through special means. They can also be bought from Klei Entertainment directly by purchasing specific [Curio Chests](/wiki/Treasury "Treasury").

The [Trade Inn](/wiki/Trade_Inn "Trade Inn") interface can be used to exchange nine unwanted Skins or Belongings to an item of a higher rarity tier. Unwanted Curios can also be unraveled into [Spools](/wiki/Spools "Spools") which can then be weaved into other items.

For Skins specifically, there are five different categories ([Head Skins](/wiki/Skins#Head_Skins "Skins"), [Body Skins](/wiki/Skins#Body_Skins "Skins"), [Hands Skins](/wiki/Skins#Hands_Skins "Skins"), [Legs Skins](/wiki/Skins#Legs_Skins "Skins") and [Feet Skins](/wiki/Skins#Feet_Skins "Skins")) which can be combined freely to change the player character's appearance. Players can choose what Skins their character will wear in the Character Select screen and ingame by using a [Wardrobe](/wiki/Wardrobe "Wardrobe"). Skins are entirely cosmetic only and do not have a function ingame, all of them are non-gender-specific.

### Mods[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Mods](/wiki/Mods "Mods")*

*Don't Starve Together* supports mods, yet many of them that rewrite core *Don't Starve* code had to be updated to the new formats. In DST, there are three kinds of mods:

* **client-only**, which are enabled by each player individually and used on any server. These usually make changes to the interface.
* **server-only**, which must be enabled on the server, but no joining players need to download. These usually make small changes to game mechanics, such as changing the timing of things, or scaling creature stats.
* **all-clients**, which all players on a server need to have. The Steam Workshop automatically handles downloading and enabling these for players when they join a server with an all-clients mod enabled. These mods can change almost anything about the game.

### Xbox Achievements[]

The Xbox One version of *Don't Starve Together* has 36 achievements.

## Cyclum Puzzles[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Cyclum Puzzles](/wiki/Cyclum_Puzzles "Cyclum Puzzles")*

With the official release of the game, a new comic was released in which one must complete a series of puzzles to keep following along. The story takes place right after the ending of the adventure mode, when Wilson frees Maxwell from the throne. It is revealed that [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") saved Wilson from the throne and sent him back to the Wilderness, taking the throne for herself and thus becoming the main antagonist of *Don't Starve Together*.

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* The way [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") creates the multiplayer portal (shown below) is similar to how he created [Maxwell's Door](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door"), both of which bring people into the [Constant](/wiki/The_Constant "The Constant"). Silhouettes of [Wendy](/wiki/Wendy "Wendy"), [Wes](/wiki/Wes "Wes"), and [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang") can be seen in the portal.
  + The Cyclum Puzzles reveal that Maxwell assisted Wilson while creating the [Jury-Rigged Portal](/wiki/Jury-Rigged_Portal "Jury-Rigged Portal"), which was destroyed by Charlie right after being turned on and was replaced with the [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern").
* [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona") is the first playable character exclusive to *Don't Starve Together*.
* The main menu changes depending on in-game events and updates.
