## Advantages[]

Wendy's main special power is her ability to summon her dead twin sister, [Abigail](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail"). Wendy starts with [Abigail's Flower](/wiki/Abigail%27s_Flower "Abigail's Flower") in her inventory. She will be able to summon Abigail immediately and gain 15 Sanity.
Wendy can ask Abigail to stay close to her or roam more free via Abigail's flower. In the *Soothe* state Abigail follows Wendy and will attack [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") that either attack Wendy or that Wendy herself attacks. In the *Rile up* state Abigail attacks every Mob near Wendy, enemy or neutral. Wendy can decide to retire Abigail by attacking her (using force attack) or clicking on her while dragging an Abigail's Flower, losing 15 Sanity in the process.

Abigail starts with a health pool of 150 Abigail's health. Her health changes to 300 health after 1 day and goes to 600 health after 1 additional day. The process is 4 times faster if there is a fully decorated [Sisturn](/wiki/Sisturn "Sisturn") in the World. Abigail goes back to her initial health when she is destroyed by an enemy or when Wendy is revived after death. Abigail has a protective shield. When attacked, a protective shield surrounds her and absorbs all other damage within a small window of time after the first attack.

Wendy can assist [Pipspooks](/wiki/Pipspook "Pipspook") to recover their lost toys and gain [Mourning Glories](/wiki/Mourning_Glory "Mourning Glory") as a reward. Wendy does not lose sanity due to [Ghosts](/wiki/Ghost "Ghost"), Pipspooks and [Ghost Characters](/wiki/Ghost_Characters "Ghost Characters"). Ghosts are neutral towards Wendy, but will attack if provoked.

Wendy had exclusive access to the [Ectoherbology Tab](/wiki/Ectoherbology_Tab "Ectoherbology Tab") to craft [Ghostly Elixirs](/wiki/Ghostly_Elixir "Ghostly Elixir"). There are 6 Ghostly Elixirs:

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revenant Restorative | [**Revenant Restorative**](/wiki/Ghostly_Elixir#Revenant_Restorative "Ghostly Elixir") | Restores bonus 2 Abigail's health per second (960 health restored in total over duration) | 8 minutes (1 day) | https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b0/Revenant Restorative Buff Badge.png/revision/latest?cb=20200320231725 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/b/b0/Revenant Restorative Buff Badge.png/revision/latest?cb=20200320231725 | Mourning Gloryx1 Spider Glandx1 |

| Distilled Vengeance | **[Distilled Vengeance](/wiki/Ghostly_Elixir#Distilled_Vengeance "Ghostly Elixir")** | Doubles the duration of Abigail's protective shield from 0.5 to 1 seconds In addition to absorbing damage, all [Mobs](/wiki/Mobs "Mobs") attacking a shield take 20 damage. | 8 minutes (1 day) | https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/72/Distilled Vengeance Buff Badge.png/revision/latest?cb=20200320231632 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/7/72/Distilled Vengeance Buff Badge.png/revision/latest?cb=20200320231632 | Mourning Gloryx3 Living Logx1 |

Wendy can also exclusively craft the Sisturn through the [Structures Tab](/wiki/Structures_Tab "Structures Tab"). The Sisturn can be decorated with petals to generate a sanity aura of +25 Sanity/min.

Abigail's attacks beset her opponents with ghostly petals for a short period of time, increasing the damage they receive by 10% for 2 seconds. Wendy players will deal an additional 40% damage to vexed enemies. Combined, Wendy deals 1.155× the normal damage compared to 0.75× under regular circumstances.

Wendy suffers 25% less Sanity drain from Darkness and from being near insanity auras. The effect only extends to those two cases though, meaning that other things that drain Sanity (e.g. [Rain](/wiki/Rain "Rain"), [Dark Sword](/wiki/Dark_Sword "Dark Sword"), [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat") etc.) will drain at the normal rate.

## Disadvantage[]

Wendy's attacks are 25% weaker than most other Characters' in order to balance out the ability to summon Abigail and the lowered sanity drain.

Wendy loses 30 Sanity when Abigail is destroyed by an enemy and her power level is reset.

## Tips[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Guides/Character guides-Wendy](/wiki/Guides/Character_guides-Wendy "Guides/Character guides-Wendy")*

* Early on the easiest way to summon Abigail is to kill a Butterfly, which will die in 1 hit even when Wendy is unarmed. Alternatively the Flower can be dropped near a [Spider Den](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") that also has a [Pig House](/wiki/Pig_House "Pig House") nearby. Getting the [Pig](/wiki/Pig "Pig")  and [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders") to fight each other will ensure Abigail is summoned from the casualties.
* Abigail won't keep fighting Mobs forever and sometimes needs to be ordered to do so mid-fight. Keep an eye on the battle so to keep her focused on the task.
* Since she can outrun [Rabbits](/wiki/Rabbits "Rabbits"), Abigail is a source of easy [Morsels](/wiki/Morsels "Morsels").
* Abigail is at her strongest during Winter since days are shorter and she deals bonus damage as the sky darkens. Leave any unfinished fights against neutral foes ([Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard"), [Spider Queens](/wiki/Spider_Queen "Spider Queen"), etc.) for this season.
  + Although it is always dark in [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves"), there's a day-night system in place, meaning Abigail will not always do 40 damage per hit. In the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins") though it's always considered Night.
* Abigail can tank and damage [Pengulls](/wiki/Pengull "Pengull") rather easily, and can take the full camp with Wendy's help at Dusk without too much risk. This means Wendy has a fairly reliable source of Food in the Winter.
* While Abigail is great against groups of weaker foes, fighting stronger Mobs will result in her death unless she's helped by Wendy. Great support weapons are the [Ice Staff](/wiki/Ice_Staff "Ice Staff") and [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff"). The Ice Staff can be used to stun enemies before they land a hit on Abigail, preventing her from taking damage. The Fire Staff can stun Mobs for longer while also damaging them but comes at the cost of possibly burning the dropped loot upon the enemy's death.
* Despite the Sanity icon not displaying an arrow, the [Top Hat](/wiki/Top_Hat "Top Hat") will not completely keep Sanity from draining in the dark.
* Weapons that deal indirect damage ([Fire Dart](/wiki/Fire_Dart "Fire Dart"), [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder"), etc.) are not affected by Wendy's damage multiplier making them excellent choices for her.
  + A good [Melee Weapon](/wiki/Weapons#Melee_weapons "Weapons") for Wendy is the [Ham Bat](/wiki/Ham_Bat "Ham Bat"), since it has unlimited uses while fresh, effectively erasing one of the drawbacks of the reduced damage.
* With a [Garland](/wiki/Garland "Garland") and a [Pretty Parasol](/wiki/Pretty_Parasol "Pretty Parasol") equipped, Wendy suffers almost no sanity drain at night, meaning gathering 18 [Petals](/wiki/Petals "Petals") can keep her sanity up during both night and day during the early days when other sanity-restoring alternatives are unavailable.
* Care should be taken when fighting alongside Abigail, as a single hit from Wendy dismisses her. This is particularly important on the console versions of the game, as the automatic targeting can accidentally attack her instead of an enemy.
* Taming an Ornery [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") can be very advantageous for Wendy, taking away her damage reduction and giving her a reliable method of combat when Abigail is unavailable.
* Wendy's [Favorite Food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Banana Pop](/wiki/Banana_Pop "Banana Pop"), meaning she gains 15 bonus Hunger when consuming the item.
* Wendy can order Abigail to attack and kill monsters and innocent creatures that increase [Naughtiness](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus"), such as [Glommer](/wiki/Glommer "Glommer"). This method can be used to prevent Krampus from spawning, if the player does not desire to trigger the spawning of one or more.

## Bugs[]

* While wearing some of the hats, Wendy's flower and the top of her hair will disappear when the player moves towards the top of the screen, and will appear again when she stops moving.
