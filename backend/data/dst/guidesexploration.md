hello! I will teach you how I explore the map!

I always play as [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78"), so I can stockpile food. I always go around the [ocean](/wiki/Ocean "Ocean") to outline the map, then go fill in the inside. Avoid early battles, but set up a [science machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") for a [spear](/wiki/Spear "Spear"), [log suit](/wiki/Log_Suit "Log Suit") and [boards](/wiki/Boards "Boards"). Perhaps even a [football helmet](/wiki/Football_Helmet "Football Helmet")

If a [hound](/wiki/Hound "Hound") attack occurs, wear all. Here are things you will have to confront;

1. night
2. food
3. [treeguards](/wiki/Treeguards "Treeguards")
4. [spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider")
5. clockworks
6. [sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") drain
7. [health](/wiki/Health "Health") loss
8. hound attacks
9. inventory space

These are avoidable:

* fire damage
* [overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") (DST)
* boss fights
* spleunking
* [Maxwell's door](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door")
* wooden thing set pieces
* general fighting

if anything is incorrect, please comment.
