**“**What year is it out there? Time moves differently here.**”**

–[Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell")

**The Constant**, unofficially referred to as **Maxwell's World**, is the main setting of *[Don't Starve](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve "Don't Starve")* and *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. Most of the main [characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters") were trapped in this world through various means and are forced to survive its many perils. The Constant was first named in *Don't Starve Together* for the text description of certain [Curios](/wiki/Curios "Curios") released during *[The Forge](/wiki/The_Forge "The Forge")* in 2017.

The Constant consists of all the playable areas of *Don't Starve* and *Don't Starve Together*, including the [Surface World](/wiki/Surface_World "Surface World"), [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves"), [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins"), and possibly the worlds of *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Shipwrecked "Shipwrecked")* and *[Hamlet](/wiki/Hamlet "Hamlet")*. These areas are contained in separate dimensions within the Constant itself. In *Don't Starve Together*, the [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern") connects these dimensions, allowing survivors to travel between them.[[1]](#cite_note-1)

The Constant is under the influence of "[Them](/wiki/Them "Them")" and the current occupant of the [Nightmare Throne](/wiki/Nightmare_Throne "Nightmare Throne"). During *Don't Starve*, this throne was ruled by [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell/NPC "Maxwell/NPC"), but by the end of [Adventure Mode](/wiki/Adventure_Mode "Adventure Mode"), he is freed and replaced by the player character. As of *Don't Starve Together*'s expansion *[A New Reign](/wiki/A_New_Reign "A New Reign")*, the throne was taken away from [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") by [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie").

Much of the Constant as encountered by the characters in *Don't Starve* and its DLCs was designed by [Maxwell](/wiki/Maxwell "Maxwell") through an unknown method of experimentation. According to Maxwell, when he was first brought to the Constant, there wasn't much in existence and he built onto it during his time on the Nightmare Throne.[[2]](#cite_note-2) However, many things existed in the world before Maxwell's reign such as [Merms](/wiki/Merm "Merm"),[[3]](#cite_note-3) ruins of an [Ancient Civilization](/wiki/Ancient_Civilization "Ancient Civilization"), and [Depths Worms](/wiki/Depths_Worm "Depths Worm").[[4]](#cite_note-4) It's implied that many of the features added in *A New Reign* are the creations of Charlie.

Time doesn't flow normally in the Constant. This is expressed through Maxwell and Charlie who both wonder how much time has passed in the real world in certain quotes,[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[6]](#cite_note-6) or through observation by [Wagstaff](/wiki/Wagstaff "Wagstaff").[[7]](#cite_note-7) Wagstaff also notes that the rates of plant growth, meat drying, and [Beefalo](/wiki/Beefalo "Beefalo") hair regrowth are unnaturally fast.[[8]](#cite_note-8)

Characters from the real world have entered the Constant through different methods. Maxwell and Charlie were taken into the Constant through the [Codex Umbra](/wiki/Codex_Umbra "Codex Umbra"), as shown in *[The Amazing Maxwell - The Final Act](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#The_Amazing_Maxwell_-_The_Final_Act "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*. This event is implied to have caused the [1906 San Francisco Earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake "wikipedia:1906 San Francisco earthquake").

In *[Forbidden Knowledge](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Forbidden_Knowledge "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*, Maxwell (through a Voxola [Radio](/wiki/Radio "Radio")) offered [Wilson](/wiki/Wilson "Wilson") secret knowledge to build the portal known as [Maxwell's Door](/wiki/Maxwell%27s_Door "Maxwell's Door") which brought him into the Constant once activated. In *[Next of Kin](/wiki/Animated_Shorts_and_Trailers#Next_of_Kin "Animated Shorts and Trailers")*, it was revealed that Wagstaff built a similar machine and used his invention to enter the Constant himself. Activating this gateway created an explosion that destroyed the portal and eventually his entire factory. [Winona](/wiki/Winona "Winona") was able to repair this portal before the entire building collapsed. Suddenly, Charlie came through it in her Night Monster form and dragged Winona into the gateway. Despite entering the Constant within a close period of time, Wagstaff entered during Maxwell's reign (*Don't Starve*) and Winona entered either just before or after Charlie usurped the throne (*Don't Starve Together*).

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* According to *Rhymes with Play* #162, the Constant is a separate dimension from the "hub" mentioned by [Battlemaster Pugna](/wiki/Battlemaster_Pugna "Battlemaster Pugna").
* The Constant has not yet been directly named in-game outside of flavor text for various [Curios](/wiki/Curios "Curios"), though Maxwell still refers to it as "his world" in some of his examination quotes for *Don't Starve Together*.[[9]](#cite_note-9)
* [Wilba](/wiki/Wilba "Wilba") and [Wormwood](/wiki/Wormwood "Wormwood") from the *Hamlet* DLC, along with [Wurt](/wiki/Wurt "Wurt") from *Don't Starve Together*, are the only survivors to originate from the Constant itself. [Wortox](/wiki/Wortox "Wortox") of *Don't Starve Together* is from a different plane of existence altogether.
* The concept of dying and restarting a world in-game seems to be an aspect of the Constant itself. This would mean that each time a survivor is killed, they're revived in a different dimension.[[10]](#cite_note-timeline-10) Also, rifts may exist between the Constant and the real world, allowing items to move between the two realities, as stated by one of Wagstaff's quotes.[[11]](#cite_note-11)
