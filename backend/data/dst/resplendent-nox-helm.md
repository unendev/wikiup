The Resplendent Nox Helm is an item added in The Forge event in Don't Starve Together. Drops in the middle of the tenth wave from a random enemy unit with a 50% chance, a flowering wreath may drop instead. If not dropped, it is guaranteed to drop from the Great Furnace Warrior Hog.

It is put on the cell of the head. Increases physical damage by 15%, reduces ability recharge speed by 10%, and increases character's movement speed by 10%.

## Prototype Tips[]

* Blooming Wreath is a better option for a successful run, but if you get a Magnificent Helm of Might instead, don't despair. It is recommended that this helmet be worn by a player practicing darts (like Wilson or Wendy) to deal more damage to enemies and accumulate the special ability of darts more often. The speed bonus can help you dodge the Warrior Hog's fire lines after it hits the ground with its grappling hooks while moving around the boss.
