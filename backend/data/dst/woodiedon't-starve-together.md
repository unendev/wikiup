`"woodie"`

**Woodie** starts off with an Axe named [Lucy](/wiki/Lucy_the_Axe "Lucy the Axe"). Lucy is sentient and talks to Woodie, egging him on while chopping down Trees, and warning him about the curse. Lucy talks in red text to differentiate from Woodie's white text. Lucy has infinite durability and reduces the amount of chops required to chop a tree but deals less damage compared to a normal [Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe").

With the corresponding [skills](/wiki/Insight "Insight"), Woodie can pick stuff faster ; craft [Boards](/wiki/Boards "Boards") at the cost of 3 [Logs](/wiki/Log "Log") instead of 4 ; craft a [Hardwood Hat](/wiki/Hardwood_Hat "Hardwood Hat"), a [Wooden Walking Stick](/wiki/Wooden_Walking_Stick "Wooden Walking Stick"), or a [Treeguard Idol](/wiki/Treeguard_Idol "Treeguard Idol").

In DST, Woodie has three transformations: The **Werebeaver**, the **Weremoose**, and the **Weregoose**. The Wereness Meter has a value of 100 points and will decay at a rate that depends on the moon phase and on the actions being performed. A [Full Moon](/wiki/Moon_Cycle "Moon Cycle") will halve the decay rate.

The Wereness Meter's drain rate has three levels. Slowest at -25/minute (-12.5/minute during full moon), faster at -40/minute (-20/minute during full moon), and fastest at -400/minute (-200/minute during full moon). The drain rate is initially at the slowest level, getting to a faster level after every certain seconds on a timer (4 seconds for Werebeaver, 6 seconds for Weremoose, 2 seconds for Weregoose).

Performing certain actions (gnawing for Werebeaver, fighting for Weremoose, running for Weregoose) resets the timer and the drain rate back to the slowest level. This results in a total transformation time between 22/26/19 seconds (37/41/34 seconds during full moon) and 4 minutes (8 minutes during full moon). The duration of the transformations can be improved with the [Transformation Timer](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skills.

When the Wereness reaches 0, Woodie will go back to his normal human form with 0 Hunger, unless the player has the [Curse Embracer](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skill.

All Wereforms will deplete Sanity at -6.0 Sanity/minute.

Dying when transformed will cause Woodie to drop everything (as usual for all Characters) and turn into a [Ghost](/wiki/Ghost_Characters "Ghost Characters") that resembles the current Wereform instead of Woodie. If he is resurrected, he'll revive into the same Wereform with 50 Health, and 100 Sanity and the same Wereness.

During a Full Moon, Woodie will instantly turn into a random transformation, and for the duration of the Full Moon his Wereness will drain half as fast. This can be avoided with the [Lunar Renegade](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skill.

In the Werebeaver form, Woodie can chop quickly and effectively. His form can also dig, mine and hammer objects. Gnawing (chopping, digging, mining, hammering, and attacking) resets his Wereness drain rate. The Werebeaver cannot spawn a [Treeguard](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard") or [Poison Birchnut Tree](/wiki/Poison_Birchnut_Tree "Poison Birchnut Tree").

* The Werebeaver can gnaw at a rate of 3.75 gnaws per second. One gnaw counts as chopping 4 times, mining 0.5 times, digging 0.5 times, or hammering 0.25 times. The gnawing efficiency can be improved with the [Werebeaver](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skills.
* It takes 1.033 seconds to gnaw down a large [Tree](/wiki/Tree "Tree") (5.167 - 7.0 seconds with an [Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe")), 3.1 seconds to gnaw down a [Boulder](/wiki/Boulder "Boulder") (2.167 - 2.867 seconds with a [Pickaxe](/wiki/Pickaxe "Pickaxe")), 0.467 seconds to gnaw up a stump (0.867 seconds with a [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel")), and 4.2 seconds to gnaw down a [Structure](/wiki/Structures "Structures") (1.3 - 1.933 seconds with a [Hammer](/wiki/Hammer "Hammer")).
* The Werebeaver's melee attack deals 27.2 damage with an attack interval of 0.433 seconds. He deals 44.2 damage instead to Treeguards and Birchnutters.
* The Werebeaver reduces 25% of any damage taken. This includes physical damage, fire damage, freezing damage, overheating damage, and every other kind of damage.
* The Werebeaver moves at 110% of normal speed.
* The Werebeaver can also smash the ground with his tail to destroy objects around him, if the player chose the [Werebeaver Mastery](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skill.

The Weremoose deals a high amount of damage and has a high damage reduction. The cursed form can perform a tackle, charging in a straight line at high speed. Attacking or being attacked resets his Wereness drain rate.

* The Weremoose's melee attack deals 59.5 damage, but has a slightly longer attack interval (0.5 seconds) than regular [Melee Weapons](/wiki/Weapon "Weapon") (0.433 seconds). This results in about a 15% lower DPS than a fresh [Ham Bat](/wiki/Ham_Bat "Ham Bat"). His damage is increased if the player chose the [Weremoose Mastery](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skill.
* The Weremoose reduces 90% of any damage taken. This includes physical damage, fire damage, freezing damage, overheating damage, and every other kind of damage. The damage reduction is increased if the player chose the [Weremoose Mastery](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skill.
* The Weremoose moves at 90% of normal speed. Speed can be improved with the [Weremoose I](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skill.
* The Weremoose's charge covers a distance of up to approximately 20 units (length of 5 turf tiles). He moves at 12 units/second (200% of normal speed) while charging. He charges in a straight line and cannot change direction or manually stop, unless the player has the [Weremoose III](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skill.
* Mobs hit by the charge will take 59.5 damage. If the charge collides with a solid obstacle, the charge is halted and the Weremoose is [slowed down](/wiki/Sleeping#Grogginess "Sleeping") for 10 seconds. The obstacle will also be chopped 8 times, mined 4 times, hammered 2 times, or damaged by -119 health.
* The Weremoose has complete stun immunity (cannot be interrupted or stunlocked) while charging, except for 0.233 seconds at the start of the charge and 0.067 seconds at the end of the charge. He can only be interrupted mid-charge by crashing into a solid obstacle, by being frozen, by being put to sleep, or by being attacked with knock-back.
* The Weremoose slowly heals himself if the player has the [Weremoose II](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skill.

The Weregoose moves 40% faster than Woodie in his normal form, and can run over water. The Weregoose can't perform any other action than running. Running resets his Wereness drain rate. Woodie immediately drowns if he transforms back to normal while on water.

His speed can be furthermore increased with the [Weregoose I](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skill. The Weregoose becomes 100% waterproof with the [Weregoose II](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skill. The [Weregoose III](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skill also allows him to perform a dodge, to avoid incoming attacks.

## Disadvantage[]

When his Wereness Meter reaches 0, the [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger") meter is set at 0, unless the player has the [Curse Embracer](/wiki/Insight "Insight") skill.

## Tips[]

* Due to Lucy's infinite durability it's a waste to craft other axes (Axe and Luxury Axe) unless the player desperately needs a better weapon in the early days.
* Players are advised to calculate beforehand the days in which it will be a Full Moon and prepare accordingly for the transformation.
* If possible, players should try to transform back to human in a safe place, such as camp and to bring, or stash supplies to help regain hunger, sanity, and possibly health.
* If Woodie is in a were-form the moment a full-moon starts, he stays in that form and the were-meter is refreshed. With careful timing, he can avoid random transformations AND achieve near double-duration of the desired form.
* To get [Glommer](/wiki/Glommer "Glommer") as Woodie, simply start the night next to [Glommer's Flower](/wiki/Glommer%27s_Flower "Glommer's Flower") and let the were meter expire (don't move as goose, fight as moose, or gnaw as beaver). Even with the skill tree maxed, the meter will run out before dawn, giving Woodie enough time to grab the flower.
* Woodie's [favorite food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Honey Nuggets](/wiki/Honey_Nuggets "Honey Nuggets"), meaning he gains 15 bonus Hunger when consuming the meal.
* During his transformations, Woodie is immune to the slowness caused by [Sandstorms](/wiki/Sandstorm "Sandstorm") in the Oasis Desert in Summer or [Moonstorm](/wiki/Moonstorm "Moonstorm"). This means that while transformed, the player can fight [Antlion](/wiki/Antlion "Antlion") without the need for [Desert Goggles](/wiki/Goggles#Desert_Goggles "Goggles").
* Woodie will drop his equipped items, except for backpacks, when transforming. Players should prepare some empty slots for his equipped items and be ready to unequip them before transforming.
* Players should avoid transforming at a high hunger meter since Woodie loses all of his hunger when he transforms back to normal. Try keeping his hunger around 37.5 before transforming in order to conserve food.
* Because Woodie loses all hunger during a Wereform, it is advised to do it at 0 hunger to minimize the hunger lost. Frequent and careful use of transformations lets Woodie have a practically slower hunger rate than normal.
* The Weremoose can use his charge over and over against large groups of mobs. Players can take advantage of his unique ability to dispatch multiple enemies at once.
* The Weremoose's charge ability allows him to defeat groups of [Spiders](/wiki/Spider "Spider") and [Spider Warriors](/wiki/Spider_Warrior "Spider Warrior") faster and more effectively than [Abigail](/wiki/Abigail "Abigail"). Used properly, he can quite easily clear several Tier 3 [Spider Dens](/wiki/Spider_Den "Spider Den") on his own. The Weremoose is generally great for clearing crowds such as [Beefalo herds](/wiki/Beefalo#Herds "Beefalo"), massive [Hound waves](/wiki/Hound#Periodic_Hound_Attacks "Hound"), [Chess Monsters](/wiki/Chess_Monsters "Chess Monsters") found in [Chess biomes](/wiki/Chess "Chess") or the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins"), [Nightmare Creatures](/wiki/Nightmare_Cycle#Nightmare_Phase "Nightmare Cycle"), and [Frog Rains](/wiki/Rain#Frog_Rain "Rain").
* As Weremoose, it's faster to travel by charging repeatedly than by walking. Be careful not to crash into solid objects on the way. The charge can also be used to escape dangerous situations, such as when the Weremoose is low on health.
* Make sure to keep Woodie's health full before transforming, especially with the Weremoose, since he cannot heal himself during a transformation. Players should keep in mind that transforming using a Kitschy Idol leaves Woodie with 130 health at most.
* The Weregoose is excellent for quickly exploring the map early in the game, especially because of its ability to cross ocean gaps between biomes. Consider bringing an extra goose idol or several [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft") so that you can transform back to Woodie on Lunar Island to pick up things ([Stone Fruit Bushes](/wiki/Stone_Fruit_Bush "Stone Fruit Bush") and [Kelp Fronds](/wiki/Kelp_Fronds "Kelp Fronds")) without becoming stranded. [Marotters](/wiki/Marotter "Marotter") can steal idols from your inventory in goose form, so be cautious.
* Woodie does not suffer from the [Piggyback's](/wiki/Piggyback "Piggyback") speed penalty when transformed, and so it is suggested to at least consider using a Piggyback when going out to gather many items at once, such as logs and Spider drops since the speed penalty will not affect the Wereforms efficiency.
* During a transformation, Woodie can still raise his [Naughtiness](/wiki/Krampus#Naughtiness "Krampus") rating and cause [Krampus](/wiki/Krampus "Krampus") to arrive.
* In DST, Woody has additional 45 insulation from his beard.
