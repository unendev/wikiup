**Overheating** is a game mechanic introduced in the *[Reign of Giants](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Reign_of_Giants "Don't Starve: Reign of Giants")* DLC, as well as appearing in the *[Shipwrecked](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Shipwrecked "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked")* and *[Hamlet](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve:_Hamlet "Don't Starve: Hamlet")* DLCs, as well as *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*. It functions as the counterpart to [Freezing](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing"). Overheating happens during [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") or [Dry Season](/wiki/Dry_Season "Dry Season"). Overheating can also occur while the player is standing close to a sufficient heat source for a long period of time. When the player begins to take in too much heat (at 65° C), the edge of the screen will begin to turn orange and become a hazy ring while a sizzling sound plays, warning the player. At 70° C, an additional reddish ring will appear within the orange haze ring and a harsher sizzling sound will play. The character will make an exclamation to warn of the high temperature (eg. "Hot as heck!") and the player will begin to take damage. The only way to stop this is by cooling off, such as being near a sufficiently cold source.

## Survival[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/9/90/Wilson-overheat.png/revision/latest?cb=20140812061821 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/9/90/Wilson-overheat.png/revision/latest?cb=20140812061821 

Wilson overheating from his beard.

 

Overheating can be overcome in two ways: by reducing the player's temperature, and by preventing player's temperature from rising rapidly. Surviving [Summer](/wiki/Summer "Summer") or [Dry Season](/wiki/Dry_Season "Dry Season") will depend on a combination of these.

### Cooling Down[]

There are several ways to cool oneself down:

* An [Endothermic Fire](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire "Endothermic Fire"), [Endothermic Fire Pit](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire_Pit "Endothermic Fire Pit") or [Polar Light](/wiki/Moon_Caller%27s_Staff "Moon Caller's Staff") is a stationary light source that works like a [fire](/wiki/Fire "Fire"), but they cool the player instead.
* A [Chilled Amulet](/wiki/Chilled_Amulet "Chilled Amulet"), [Ice Cube](/wiki/Ice_Cube "Ice Cube"), or [Fashion Melon](/wiki/Fashion_Melon "Fashion Melon") will lower temperature when worn. Note that these have different cooling values. The Ice Cube and Fashion Melon will also cause [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") while worn, so caution is advised especially as [WX-78](/wiki/WX-78 "WX-78").
* Using a [Luxury Fan](/wiki/Luxury_Fan "Luxury Fan") or [Lucky Fan](/wiki/Year_of_the_Gobbler#Lucky_Fan "Year of the Gobbler") Don't Starve Together icon will lower the player's temperature instantly. The [Luxury Fan](/wiki/Luxury_Fan "Luxury Fan") has 15 uses while the [Lucky Fan](/wiki/Year_of_the_Gobbler#Lucky_Fan "Year of the Gobbler") Don't Starve Together icon has 3 uses. However, when used, they put out fires, so the player should be wary around light sources.
* Equipping the [Whirly Fan](/wiki/Whirly_Fan "Whirly Fan") Don't Starve Together icon will also lower the player's temperature, but only while the player is running.
* Eating one of the following food items will temporarily cool the player down by 1°C per second for various amounts of time. Eating even stale or spoiled food can also cool the player down.
  + Watermelon [Watermelon](/wiki/Watermelon "Watermelon"): 5 seconds
  + Fruit Medley [Fruit Medley](/wiki/Fruit_Medley "Fruit Medley"): 5 seconds
  + Ice [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice"): 7.5 seconds
  + Melonsicle [Melonsicle](/wiki/Melonsicle "Melonsicle"): 10 seconds
  + Ice Cream [Ice Cream](/wiki/Ice_Cream "Ice Cream"): 15 seconds
  + Ceviche [Ceviche](/wiki/Ceviche "Ceviche") Shipwrecked icon DST icon: 10 seconds
  + Banana Pop [Banana Pop](/wiki/Banana_Pop "Banana Pop") Shipwrecked icon DST icon: 10 seconds
  + Jelly-O Pop [Jelly-O Pop](/wiki/Jelly-O_Pop "Jelly-O Pop") Shipwrecked icon: 10 seconds
  + Neon Quattro [Neon Quattro](/wiki/Neon_Quattro "Neon Quattro") Shipwrecked icon
  + Tropical Bouillabaisse [Tropical Bouillabaisse](/wiki/Tropical_Bouillabaisse "Tropical Bouillabaisse") Shipwrecked icon
  + Iced Tea [Iced Tea](/wiki/Iced_Tea "Iced Tea") Hamlet icon
  + Asparagazpacho [Asparagazpacho](/wiki/Asparagazpacho "Asparagazpacho") DST icon: 40 degrees lower than environment for 5 minutes.
* [Wetness](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness") will decrease gained temperature up to 30°C at the cost of [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") and negative effects on items.
* The player can sleep during the day in a [Siesta Lean-to](/wiki/Siesta_Lean-to "Siesta Lean-to") to cool down and skip to dusk, thus preventing further overheating.
* A [Thermal Stone](/wiki/Thermal_Stone "Thermal Stone") can be brought near an [Endothermic Fire](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire "Endothermic Fire") or [Endothermic Fire Pit](/wiki/Endothermic_Fire_Pit "Endothermic Fire Pit") to cool it or placed in a stationary [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box") or a mobile [Snow Chester](/wiki/Snow_Chester "Snow Chester") to freeze it. It will cool the player down as long as it's in stage 1 or stage 2.
* The cheapest way to cool down is to run around a [Tree](/wiki/Tree "Tree") holding a [Whirly Fan](/wiki/Whirly_Fan "Whirly Fan").

### Delaying Overheating[]

There are several ways to delay overheating (look further below to Game Mechanics for a list):

* The [Caves](/wiki/Caves "Caves") never get warm enough to cause overheating unless a fire or heat source is used.
* Dusk and Night will slow down the rate at which heat is gained (60/120 Insulation respectively).
* One can stay under a [Tree](/wiki/Tree "Tree") to delay overheating. Near the beginning and end of Summer, this will be enough to prevent overheating damage. However, during the middle of Summer, Trees (other than [Knobbly Trees](/wiki/Knobbly_Tree "Knobbly Tree")) alone won't provide enough protection to prevent overheating. In the *Shipwrecked* DLC, there is no risk in doing so in Dry Season, as the temperature is not as severe compared to Summer.
  + In the *Hamlet* DLC, the effect of being [indoor](/wiki/Category:Interiors "Category:Interiors") is the same as that of staying under a tree.
* In *Don't Starve Together*, the temperature under the canopy of [Great Tree Trunk](/wiki/Great_Tree_Trunk "Great Tree Trunk") and [Above-Average Tree Trunk](/wiki/Above-Average_Tree_Trunk "Above-Average Tree Trunk") never rises above 68 degrees (unless a fire or heat source is used there)
* Wearing gear with high Overheating resistance, such as [Eyebrella](/wiki/Eyebrella "Eyebrella").

## Game Mechanics[]

Overheating mechanics are based on the temperature implementations in the game. A player character has a **body temperature**, which ranges from **-20°** to **90°**. Any time body temperature rises above **70°**, the character will take **1.25** damage per second.

### Rate of Temperature Change[]

Ambient temperature is a key factor influencing a character's body temperature. Body temperature will attempt to match the ambient temperature at one of two rates: the **ambient delta** which is determined by all heat and cold sources, or the **insulated rate** which depends on insulation values of clothing worn by the character. The rate is in degrees per second, and the game will choose whichever value is larger.

#### Ambient Delta[]

The **ambient delta** is a rate that takes into account the total effect of all heat sources affecting the player, including the weather, campfires and Thermal Stones. It is also a function of the player's current temperature.

The rate determined by the ambient delta is given by:

```
ambient_delta = min(warming_cap, sum(net_temp_eff(source) for all sources))

```

where the **warming cap** is a value equal to 1 or 5, and the **net temperature effect** (net\_temp\_eff) is the effect of a heat/cold source on the player's body temperature. The ambient delta is either the warming cap or the sum of the net temperature effects (whichever value is smaller).

The **warming cap** is the maximum rate of temperature increase, and depends on the player's body temperature. The rate will be **+5°** per second while the player's body temperature is below the freezing point of **0°**, and **+1°** per second once the player's body temperature is warmer than the freezing point.

The **net temperature effect** of a heat/cold source depends on the difference between the heat source temperature (values listed in the Heat Sources table below) and the player's body temperature:

```
net_temp_eff(source) = max(source_temperature - body_temperature, 0) + min(source_temperature, 0)

```

The following items, when equipped, provide varying levels of resistance to overheating. Some of these items, like the Eyebrella or Floral Shirt, can prevent overheating for the entire day on their own, if the player is fully cooled each night.

#### Insulated Rate[]

When the ambient delta is smaller than the insulated rate, the player's body temperature will increase by:

```
insulated_rate = 30 / (30 + total_insulation)

```

Note: For the purpose of calculating a **Thermal Stone**'s own temperature gain, a fixed insulation of 120 is used. This value is not added to the player's total insulation, nor does the player's insulation affect the Thermal Stone in any way. A Thermal Stone warms at the same rate on the ground as it does in the inventory.

In the *Hamlet* DLC / *Don't Starve Together*, the canopy in [Deep Rainforest](/wiki/Deep_Rainforest "Deep Rainforest") and [Gas Rainforest](/wiki/Gas_Rainforest "Gas Rainforest") biomes / [Waterlogged](/wiki/Waterlogged "Waterlogged") biome will provide shelter, granting 180 overheating insulation.

## Don't Starve Together icon Don't Starve Together[]

In *Don't Starve Together*, insulation mechanics differ from *Don't Starve* and its DLCs, affecting how Overheating and Freezing works.

From mid-Autumn to early Spring, the game prioritizes Winter insulation values and ignores Summer insulation values. This means that wearing an item meant to overcome Overheating (such as an Eyebrella) will have no effect on the player's temperature, while an item meant to overcome Freezing (such as a Beefalo Hat) will keep the player's temperature from lowering as intended.

Meanwhile, from mid-Spring to early Autumn, the game prioritizes Summer insulation values and ignores Winter insulation values. This means that wearing an item meant to overcome Overheating (such as an Eyebrella) will keep the player's temperature from raising as intended, while an item meant to overcome Freezing (such as a Beefalo Hat) will have no effect on the player's temperature.

Willow will take damage from overheating at half the rate (0.625 health per second).

## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Despite the tropical weather, one will never overheat in the *Hamlet* DLC due to the seasons.
