The **Midsummer Cawnival** is a seasonal [Event](/wiki/Event "Event") in *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")* that recurs in the month of June. The event is based on [Summer solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice "wikipedia:Summer solstice") celebrations, and is meant to be a Summer equivalent to the annual [Winter's Feast](/wiki/Winter%27s_Feast "Winter's Feast") event celebrated on the opposite end of the year.[[4]](#cite_note-4)

Midsummer's Cawnival is celebrated as a part of [Klei Entertainment](/wiki/Klei_Entertainment "Klei Entertainment")'s larger "Klei Fest" event, in which they add celebratory content updates to many of their different games and run sales on the games for the duration of the event.[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[6]](#cite_note-6)

–[Wanda](/wiki/Wanda "Wanda")

**Corvus Goodfeather** allows the player to begin the event as well as purchase games and tokens once the [Cawnival Tree](#Cawnival_Tree) has been placed. He will stay at the [Florid Postern](/wiki/Florid_Postern "Florid Postern") if the Cawnival Tree is yet to have been planted in a world. However, if the player plants the Cawnival Tree elsewhere and rings the bell, he will fly to the location of the tree.

Corvus is marked out on the map similarly to mobs like [Chester](/wiki/Chester "Chester"). When the player is playing a minigame, he will watch and comment on the player when they are playing the game well. Once the minigame ends, depending on how well the player did, he will give the player extra prize tickets.

Upon getting close enough to Corvus, a new crafting filter will become available named "Cawnival Creation". This filter only has the "Cawnival Sapling" initially. After purchasing and constructing the "sapling" the rest of the filter becomes available.

The **Cawnival Tree** is a craftable structure that is only available during the Midsummer Cawnival event. Interacting with the placed tree will allow the player to ring a bell, summoning [Corvus Goodfeather](/wiki/Corvus_Goodfeather "Corvus Goodfeather") to fly to the tree. Placing the tree also unlocks new items in the Cawnival Creation Filter when the player interacts with [Corvus Goodfeather](/wiki/Corvus_Goodfeather "Corvus Goodfeather"). The Cawnival Tree can be cut down with 10 hits from an [Axe](/wiki/Axe "Axe") to return it as an item.

The appearance of the tree changes slightly as the player adds new decorations around the tree and up to three new [Crow Kids](#Crow_Kid) will fly in to wander around the Cawnival as the tree is decorated.

**Crow Kids** are Cawnival spectators that will appear once the player plants the Cawnival Tree and will wander around and interact with any decorations if the player planted any nearby. The more decorations that are around the Cawnival Tree, the more Crow Kids will fly in. Whenever the player begins a minigame and any Crow Kids are nearby, they will watch the player and cheer them on whenever they are doing well. When the minigame ends, they will drop 1 prize ticket. The player can give the Crow Kids Popcorn or Corny Slush which then will drop 1 prize ticket and 1 "Cawnival Token", after this they will be seen occasionally eating one of the snacks. Only one snack can be given to a Crow Kid at the time and the player will have to wait to give the same Crow Kid a snack again, 1 hour for the Popcorn and 12 minutes for the Corny Slush.

Whenever a hostile mob approaches near them they will fly away from the danger; even a non-hostile [Shadow Creature](/wiki/Shadow_Creature "Shadow Creature") will still cause them to fly away.

Crow Kids have randomized names similar to [Bunnymen](/wiki/Bunnyman "Bunnyman") and [Pigs](/wiki/Pig "Pig").

Crow Kids are capable of adding fuel to campfires and do so whenever the fire gets low as long as it's night.

* I've been known by many names, but you may call me Corvus Goodfeather!
* "Not yet mid-summer", you say? Well my friend, the early bird gets the worm!
* Oh lucky, lucky you, to be a stop on our flight of fancy!
* Be merry, for good old Goodfeather has returned with his spectacular Cawnival!
* Last year was so profitable- er, FUN, that we just couldn't stay away!

**When a Cawnival Sapling is bought**

* Yes, yes! The centerpiece must be set!
* The Cawnival cannot begin until the Tree is planted!

**After Cawnival Tree is planted**

* The Cawnival is underway!
* Welcome, welcome, one and all!
* Buy your tokens here!
* Enjoy the Cawnival!
* Why not purchase a lovely miniature to set under the Tree?
* The games look fun, don't they? Why not purchase a token or twelve?
* Win tickets, trade tickets for fabulous prizes!
* Take a glance at the Prize Booth, friends! We have spectacular trinkets from far and wide!
* "Not yet mid-summer", you say? Well my friend, the early bird gets the worm!

**When there is no game build**

* Look here, I have such wonderful games for you to play!
* A Cawnival is not complete without some fun and games.

**When the player is not good at a game**

* Oh, I think you nearly scored a point that time!
* Have you never played a Cawnival game before?
* Better luck next time, perhaps?

**When the player is good at a game**

* Yes, yes! You're a natural!
* You've got a good grasp of the game, I see!

**After a good game**

* Well done, well done! Now why don't you go peruse our Prize Booth?
* What an astonishing display! Here, let old Corvus Goodfeather give you an extra ticket.

**When playing a non-cawnival game**

* What is this game?
* What an odd game. Not nearly as fun as the ones we have at the Cawnival!
* I'm not familiar with the rules...
