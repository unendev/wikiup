*Exclusive to:* Don't Starve Together

The **Junk Yard** is a [Set Piece](/wiki/Set_Piece "Set Piece") exclusive to *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, introduced in the *[From Beyond](/wiki/From_Beyond "From Beyond")* updates. It usually can be found in a [Forest](/wiki/Forest "Forest") biome. The Set Piece consists of a small area of barren [Turf](/wiki/Turfs "Turfs") surrounded by [Junky Fences](/wiki/Junky_Fence "Junky Fence") and some [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft"). Within the fences there are placed some [Junk Piles](/wiki/Junk_Pile "Junk Pile"), a big [Teetering Junk Pile](/wiki/Teetering_Junk_Pile "Teetering Junk Pile"), and [W.O.B.O.T.](/wiki/W.O.B.O.T. "W.O.B.O.T.") laying on the ground.

10 days after defeating the [Nightmare Werepig](/wiki/Nightmare_Werepig "Nightmare Werepig"), the [Scrappy Werepig](/wiki/Scrappy_Werepig "Scrappy Werepig") can be found trapped in the Teetering Junk Pile.

After [Lunar Rifts](/wiki/Rift_Cycle "Rift Cycle") have been activated, [Abandoned Junk](/wiki/Abandoned_Junk "Abandoned Junk") will begin to spawn periodically within the Junk Yard.

  However, the fences will not spawn unless reloading the world or rollback the following day.
