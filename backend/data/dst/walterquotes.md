## Placeholder Trivia[]

* Lord of Gourds may be a reference to the [Great pumpkin](https://peanuts.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Pumpkin) from the Peanuts comics. Both have similar characteristics like showing up on Halloween, searching for perfect pumpkin and rewarding people.
* His quote for the [Pumpkin Lantern](/wiki/Pumpkin_Lantern "Pumpkin Lantern") ("I heard a radio show about a horseman with a pumpkin for a head!") is a reference to the [Headless Horseman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_Horseman "wikipedia:Headless Horseman").
* His quote for the [Telltale Heart](/wiki/Telltale_Heart "Telltale Heart") ("Did you ever hear the story about the beating heart hidden under the floorboards?") is a direct nod to Edgar Allan Poe's short story *[The Tell-Tale Heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tell-Tale_Heart "wikipedia:The Tell-Tale Heart")*.
* His quote for the [Think Tank](/wiki/Think_Tank "Think Tank") ("We're going to need a bigger boat") may be a subtle nod to the 1975 movie *[Jaws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film) "wikipedia:Jaws (film)")*.
* Walter's quote for [On Tentacles](/wiki/Books "Books") ( "Oooh, this reminds me of a radio play where a ship gets eaten by a giant squid!") may be a reference to the myth of the [Kraken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken "wikipedia:Kraken")
* Walter's quote for the Dangling Depth Dweller Decoration, ("Weird how the spiders around here only have six legs.") is poking fun at the *Don't Starve* trope of spiders having six legs as opposed to eight.
* His quote for a picked Carrot ("I always get a bit disappointed when it doesn't turn out to be a rat.") is a reference to the [Carrat](/wiki/Carrat "Carrat").
