## Advantages[]

WX-78 is able to eat stale and spoiled Food without the related penalties, though is not immune to *all* Food penalties (such as eating [Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_Meat "Monster Meat")). This allows them to stockpile food for increased lengths of time.

WX-78 may consume [Gears](/wiki/Gears "Gears") to recover 60 Sanity 75 Hunger and 50 Health per item. Upon death, they will drop anywhere from 33-50% of the gears they've ingested during their life (rounded down), up to a cap of 40.

WX-78 has half the aggro range from [Clockworks](/wiki/Category:Clockwork_Monsters "Category:Clockwork Monsters") and Damaged Clockworks. For instance, the Clockwork Rook's normal range of 12 meters will be reduced to 6 meters towards WX-78.

Additionally, being struck by lightning will drain 33 Sanity and restore 100 Health.

### Charge Meter[]

 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f1/Wx-78CircuitsDemonstration.png/revision/latest?cb=20230516164440 https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/f/f1/Wx-78CircuitsDemonstration.png/revision/latest?cb=20230516164440 

The Charge Meter, depicted holding 5 charges, with the topmost circuit inactive due to its pin not being charged yet.

 

WX-78's main perk takes the form of their **charge meter** situated on the right of the UI. It slowly refills with charge over time. The meter has 6 bars where circuits can be plugged into, taking anywhere from 1 to all 6 of the bars depending on the circuit. Once the circuit's bars are filled, the circuit will apply its effects. **Note:** multiple circuits of the same type will stack their effects unless stated otherwise.

When a Circuit is applied to the charge meter, it will attempt to take up the lowest unoccupied pins available. Removing a Circuit via Circuit Extractor will remove the highest, and thereby latest Circuit applied.

Every 90 seconds, WX-78 will gain one unit of charge as long as they are not Starving or [Wet](/wiki/Wetness "Wetness"). WX-78 can receive one unit of Charge by using a [Lightning Rod](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod") that has been recently struck, being struck by [lightning](/wiki/Lightning "Lightning"), or eating [Electric Milk](/wiki/Electric_Milk "Electric Milk") or [Volt Goat Chaud-Froid](/wiki/Volt_Goat_Chaud-Froid "Volt Goat Chaud-Froid"). They can also be fueled by [Winona's Generators](/wiki/Winona%27s_Generator "Winona's Generator") and [Winona's G.E.M.erators](/wiki/Winona%27s_G.E.M.erator "Winona's G.E.M.erator"), which will use 90% of the generator's maximum charge and 6% of the G.E.M.erator's maximum charge.

If WX-78 becomes Frozen, two units of charge will be lost. Charge units will also be lost when using the [Circuit Extractor](/wiki/Circuit_Extractor "Circuit Extractor") to remove circuits, with the amount being equal to the amount of charge the Circuit was actively using.

Circuit Extractor **[Circuit Extractor](/wiki/Circuit_Extractor "Circuit Extractor")** - Extracts the top circuit in WX-78's system and removes an amount of charge equivalent with how many slots it took up.

Bio Scanalyzer **[Bio Scanalyzer](/wiki/Bio_Scanalyzer "Bio Scanalyzer")** - Allows WX-78 to scan living creatures to acquire blueprints for the below circuits

## Disadvantages[]

* Without any circuits, WX-78 has stats on the lower end of the spectrum and may succumb to insanity or starvation quicker than other characters.
* WX-78 takes damage from Rain at a rate of 3-9 damage Health based on their wetness and a charge slot every 5 seconds when above 15 wetness, which can pose a significant threat. Great care should be taken to avoid wetness.
* Rain damage causes WX-78 to periodically emit Light as sparks fly off their body. The light emitted is frequent and bright enough to prevent [Charlie](/wiki/Charlie "Charlie") from attacking, but comes at the cost of large amounts of Sanity due to being in complete darkness.

## Tips[]

* WX-78 acts like a [Lightning Rod](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod"). If any event launches multiple lightning strikes, such as reading [The End is Nigh](/wiki/The_End_is_Nigh "The End is Nigh"), **all** strikes will usually target WX-78.
* Equipping an [Umbrella](/wiki/Umbrella "Umbrella") alongside a hat that offers at least 10% rain protection (such as the [Straw Hat](/wiki/Straw_Hat "Straw Hat")) will completely shield WX-78 from Rain, preventing any damage from being taken.
  + WX-78 players may want to avoid using items that offer Lightning immunity (such as the Umbrella or [Eyebrella](/wiki/Eyebrella "Eyebrella")) if they require healing, though they will take a hit to their Sanity with each strike.
* Using the [Ice Cube](/wiki/Ice_Cube "Ice Cube") or [Fashion Melon](/wiki/Fashion_Melon "Fashion Melon") as protection from [Overheating](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") is not advised, as the Wetness gained from those items will damage WX-78.
* WX-78's gear consumption ability & light-providing circuits makes them one of the better equipped characters for traversing the [Ruins](/wiki/Ruins "Ruins").
* Since they ignore spoilage and food loses all sanity restoration as soon as it turns stale, WX-78 players have at least double the time to utilize foods that grant high sanity but spoil quickly, giving them a distinct advantage over other characters in terms of sanity management.
* WX-78's [favorite food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Butter Muffin](/wiki/Butter_Muffin "Butter Muffin"), meaning that they gain 15 bonus Hunger when consuming the food.
