## Advantages[]

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, all 3 of Wolfgang's stats ([Health](/wiki/Health "Health"), [Hunger](/wiki/Hunger "Hunger"), and [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity")) has a maximum of 200. Wolfgang has a new "Might Meter" which slowly decreases over time and needs to be filled via lifting weights, or performing actions (mining, chopping wood, fighting...). Wolfgang is in his Wimpy form from 0-25 mightiness, Normal form from 25-75, and Mighty form above 75. Regardless of his form. Wolfgang's Might Meter decreases faster with lower hunger, according to the table below.

| Hunger | Might Drain Rate (every 10 seconds) |
| --- | --- |
| 150-200 | -1 |
| 100-149 | -2 |
| 50-99 | -4 |
| 1-49 | -6 |
| 0 | -16 |

When Mighty, Wolfgang deals 2× damage. Mighty Wolfgang can carry heavy items like [Chess Pieces](/wiki/Chess_Pieces "Chess Pieces") at full movement speed and does not lose Might while carrying them, and he won't get a walking speed penalty from his equipping item like [Piggyback](/wiki/Piggyback "Piggyback"), [Ice Cube](/wiki/Ice_Cube "Ice Cube"), [Marble Suit](/wiki/Marble_Suit "Marble Suit"). Also, Mighty Wolfgang [freezes](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") slower, with 30 more cold insulation but at the cost of -30 [heat](/wiki/Overheating "Overheating") insulation. Each action of chopping wood, mining, or hammering things is at 150% effectiveness with a small chance to crit making it complete instantly. Wolfgang also rows at 133% effectiveness. In contrast to his pre-rework character version, Wolfgang's speed no longer changes when changing forms.

Wolfgang can build the [Mighty Gym](/wiki/Mighty_Gym "Mighty Gym") and his various [Dumbbells](/wiki/Dumbbells "Dumbbells"). Players can use the gym to gain mightiness, losing hunger in the process. The gym starts loaded with two Potato Sacks, but players can load the gym with better weights to change its effectiveness, such as with Statues or Giant Crops. To use the gym, a minigame is played where the player must lift the weights in a steady rhythm to gain mightiness. A bell slides back and forth below the gym in a slider bar, and the player must keep rhythm by ringing the bell when it comes within the center of the slider. The slider bar, when loaded with heavy objects, is white in the center, surrounded by yellow in the middle, and lastly black on the edges. Loading heavier items onto the gym will increase the white and yellow areas, thus increasing the chances for the player to complete the minigame of lifting correctly. The Mighty Gym consumes hunger as players work out, even if the player does not attempt to ring the bell.

Lifting Dumbbells on the other hand does not consume hunger and is essential to maintaining mightiness while on the move. Wolfgang can craft four types of Dumbbells; in order of increasing effectiveness they are: regular Dumbbells made of rock, Golden Dumbbells made of gold, [Marbells](/wiki/Marbell "Marbell") made of marble, and [Gembells](/wiki/Gembell "Gembell") made of purple gems. Dumbbells will lose durability as they are used, unlike the Mighty Gym. Dumbbells can also be thrown as a ranged weapon or used in melee, losing durability in the process. Running with dumbbells will pause mightiness drain, as will raising an anchor. Holding a dumbbell while moving around on a beefalo also pauses mightiness drain (this may be bug).

Besides using dumbbells and the gym, Wolfgang also gains small amounts of Mightiness when doing chores such as mining and chopping trees, as well as when attacking. Wolfgang also doesn't lose Mightiness while sleeping.

Wimpy Wolfgang has a 25% slower hunger drain and has an easier time staying cool with 30 overheat insulation, but at the cost of -30 cold insulation.

| Pitchfork | **+1.5** |

| Hammer | **+0.25** |

## Disadvantages[]

When in Wimpy form, Wolfgang deals 75% damage. Wimpy form is also 25% less effective with tools, but they last 25% longer.

The main drawback of Wolfgang is his increased sanity drain. Darkness will cause him to lose 6.25 sanity/min instead 5/min for normal characters, and if there is any follower or other player within 16 meters, the sanity drain becomes 5.5/min. Insanity aura is 10% more effective to Wolfgang, this effect can change from 10% to additional 100% depending on the number of friends and enemies that are within the area.

## Tips[]

*https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dont-starve-game/images/c/cb/Glommer.png/revision/latest?cb=20231029201751 Main article: [Guides/Character guide - Wolfgang, The Strongman](/wiki/Guides/Character_guide_-_Wolfgang,_The_Strongman "Guides/Character guide - Wolfgang, The Strongman")*

* A [Belt of Hunger](/wiki/Belt_of_Hunger "Belt of Hunger") will nullify Wolfgang's Hunger problems. This along with the fact that it provides some Sanity regeneration and extends his Mighty form to last about 5 minutes and a half, makes it an excellent item for this Character.
  + players are able to craft a [Hibearnation Vest](/wiki/Hibearnation_Vest "Hibearnation Vest") which also provides a Hunger drain reduction albeit not as big as the Belt of Hunger. That said, the Hibearnation Vest provides the highest insulation against [cold](/wiki/Freezing "Freezing") and more than twice the Sanity regeneration of the Belt, making it more desirable in [Winter](/wiki/Winter "Winter") even after the player has secured a Belt of Hunger.
* Since Wolfgang's Sanity drain penalty only applies to the dark and Monsters and is so small, it's fairly easy to overcome. Even in a ["Light's Out"](/wiki/Sandbox_Mode#Presets "Sandbox Mode") world, picking a [Flower](/wiki/Flower "Flower") a day will even out the Sanity drain with other Characters. When fighting Monsters in Mighty form, Wolfgang will actually lose less Sanity than other Characters, due to the fights being shorter, resulting in less exposure to the insanity aura.
  + A [Tam o' Shanter](/wiki/Tam_o%27_Shanter "Tam o' Shanter") provides 6.7 Sanity/min, being a great Item to manage Wolfgang's Sanity. It not only stops Sanity drain at Night even for him, but it lasts very long and even provides insulation against the cold. Sleeping in a [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent") or eating [Taffy](/wiki/Taffy "Taffy"), [Cooked Green Caps](/wiki/Cooked_Green_Cap "Cooked Green Cap"), [Jerky](/wiki/Jerky "Jerky") or [Pumpkin Cookies](/wiki/Pumpkin_Cookie "Pumpkin Cookie") is also desirable when trying to get big amounts of Sanity back quickly.
  + A Hibearnation Vest is also a good Sanity item with its 4.5 Sanity/min. What little sanity is lost at night will be regained back during the day in no time. This will be useful when the player wants to equip something else other than the Tam in the head slot.
* Apart from various traps and [Gunpowder](/wiki/Gunpowder "Gunpowder"), the [Weather Pain](/wiki/Weather_Pain "Weather Pain") and the [Fire Staff](/wiki/Fire_Staff "Fire Staff") are the only weapons not affected by Wolfgang's damage multipliers, making them effective even when Wolfgang is Wimpy.
* Due to the way the bonus damage is calculated on [Planar Damage](/wiki/Planar_Damage "Planar Damage"), they don't do as much damage as they normally would with Mighty Wolfgang, but on the other hand they won't do as low as they would with Wimpy Wolfgang making them still very good when used with him.
* Wolfgang's [favorite food](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together#Favorite_Food "Don't Starve Together") is [Roasted Potato](/wiki/Roasted_Potato#Roast_Potato "Roasted Potato"), meaning that he gains 15 bonus Hunger when consuming the food on top of the baseline 25, for a total of 40 Hunger.
* Wolfgang pauses whatever he is doing when he changes Mightiness form. This sort of pause can be fatal when running from an enemy, so try to keep the Mightiness level high enough.

## Bugs[]

* While wearing some of the hats while in Normal form, Wolfgang's mustache will disappear when the player moves towards the top of the screen.
