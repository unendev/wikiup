Small Casserole Dish is used to bake dishes. These are mainly breads, desserts and other dishes that fit on a plate. A Small Casserole Dish can be obtained from the Oven Kit. The small brazier has 3 ingredient slots.

The small casserole dish can be put into the oven. If a fire is lit in the oven, the food in the brazier will begin to bake. The cooking time depends on the intensity of the flame in the oven and on whether [Wolfgang](/wiki/Wolfgang "Wolfgang") is standing next to it. If the ingredients inside the brazier match one of the recipes, steam starts to flow from the brazier, signaling that the dish is ready. However, if you overexpose the prepared dish on the fire, the food will "escape" from the brazier, leaving gruel instead of a full-fledged dish. Also, gruel is obtained if the baked ingredients inside the brazier do not fit any of the recipes.
