## Character Summary[]

### Advantages[]

*Main article: [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom")*

* Can craft all [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") recipes even without one nearby.
* Can prototype all [Alchemy Engine](/wiki/Alchemy_Engine "Alchemy Engine") recipes with a [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine").
* Can craft [Books](/wiki/Books "Books").
* Has a large [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") pool.

### Disadvantages[]

*Main article: [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom")*

* Cannot sleep ([Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent"), [Straw Roll](/wiki/Straw_Roll "Straw Roll"), [Fur Roll](/wiki/Fur_Roll "Fur Roll"), [Siesta Lean-to](/wiki/Siesta_Lean-to "Siesta Lean-to"))
* Suffers extra from [Spoilage](/wiki/Spoilage "Spoilage").

## Finding a Home[]

When settling somewhere you should think about your sanity sources and food management. You already have access to all [Science Machine](/wiki/Science_Machine "Science Machine") recipes, this allows you to delay settling and roam around for a little longer.

* Already being able to craft Science Machine recipes, you have early access to many nice things such as a Backpack, allowing you to gather more things while exploring in the first days. But consider that you won't have access to the sanity boost triggered by first prototyping, so you might think of another way to gain sanity.
* Since you cannot sleep, you need a source of sanity other than a [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent"). Spider dens are a nice source of silk, which can be used to craft clothing that restores sanity. Additionally, [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms") (Green and Blue) are a nice source of [Sanity.](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") Before making a base, consider opening [Sink Holes](/wiki/Sink_Hole "Sink Hole") to have a look in the caves and see if there are any green or blue [Mushtree Forests](/wiki/Mushtree_Forest "Mushtree Forest") nearby. If there are, consider building your base near the [Sink Hole](/wiki/Sink_Hole "Sink Hole") (some distance away, because [Batilisks](/wiki/Batilisk "Batilisk") spawn from it).
* Since Wickerbottom can craft all Science Machine recipes, you can get yourself a [Shovel](/wiki/Shovel "Shovel") and dig up [Berry Bushes](/wiki/Berry_Bush "Berry Bush"), [Grass Tufts](/wiki/Grass_Tuft "Grass Tuft") and [Saplings](/wiki/Sapling "Sapling") in the first days, allowing you to make a nice camp quicker, as well as saving time by not doing it sooner rather than later.
* You don't need to get an [Alchemy Engine](/wiki/Alchemy_Engine "Alchemy Engine") in order to craft tier II science recipes, so you might need a little less [Gold Nuggets](/wiki/Gold_Nuggets "Gold Nuggets"), [Logs](/wiki/Logs "Logs"), and [Rocks](/wiki/Rocks "Rocks") - instead you can save them in order to craft other things, such as a [Lightning Rod](/wiki/Lightning_Rod "Lightning Rod") and/or additional [Chests](/wiki/Chest "Chest").

## Managing Hunger[]

* Food spoilage cannot be afforded, therefore, try not to grab more than you need and avoid quickly spoiling foods unless you will eat them immediately. Leave [Berries](/wiki/Berries "Berries") on their bushes and [Carrots](/wiki/Carrots "Carrots") on the ground for emergencies, because they will not spoil unless picked up. Leave [Koalefants](/wiki/Koalefant "Koalefant") and other animals alive until you need them. Do not have any mercy on [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders") however, because you need the [Silk](/wiki/Silk "Silk"), [Cooked Monster Meat](/wiki/Monster_meat "Monster meat") doesn't spoil fast and can be used in [Crock Pot](/wiki/Crock_Pot "Crock Pot") recipes, and [Spiders](/wiki/Spiders "Spiders") respawn fairly quickly.
* Getting an [Ice Box](/wiki/Ice_Box "Ice Box") is a high priority. It will delay the spoilage of your food, as well as your [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms"), which are equally important, it also stores your [Ice](/wiki/Ice "Ice") indefinitely. While you are scouting, look for sources of [Gears](/wiki/Gears "Gears"), grab as many as you can.

## Managing Sanity[]

Managing your [Sanity](/wiki/Sanity "Sanity") is important as [Wickerbottom](/wiki/Wickerbottom "Wickerbottom"), as you cannot jump into a [Tent](/wiki/Tent "Tent") like other [Characters](/wiki/Characters "Characters"). It is important to note that while insane, killing [Shadow Creatures](/wiki/Shadow_Creatures "Shadow Creatures") will restore a bit of sanity, along with providing the [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel") to make [Sleepytime Stories](/wiki/Books#Sleepytime_Stories "Books"). As with other characters, this allows maintaining low sanity without losing control entirely and obtaining [Nightmare Fuel](/wiki/Nightmare_Fuel "Nightmare Fuel"), which is especially useful for Wickerbottom. To get back to high sanity levels, the players must use worn items or food, due to her inability to sleep.

In *[Don't Starve Together](/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Together "Don't Starve Together")*, [Totally Normal Trees](/wiki/Tree/Totally_Normal "Tree/Totally Normal") will be a useful find early on as their [Living Logs](/wiki/Living_Log "Living Log") allow for the creation of [Mushroom Planters](/wiki/Mushroom_Planter "Mushroom Planter"), a health-friendly way of boosting sanity via [Mushrooms](/wiki/Mushrooms "Mushrooms") consumption. [Treeguards](/wiki/Treeguard "Treeguard") will also drop Living Logs, however, it must be noted that combat should be avoided unless completely necessary since Wickerbottom cannot gain health as easily as other characters.
